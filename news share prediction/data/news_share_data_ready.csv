day you need to embody the person that you want to be in order to become her say goodbye to your comfort zone after a certain amount of time in a specific city industry or job title it can be easy to start feeling stuck let go of behaviors that keep you feeling this way and try new things no matter how different or intimidating they might be take a risk try a class go to a networking happy hour or attend a conference or event you might learn something new about yourself professionally or personally be extremely selective with your time donâ t overbook you can t be everywhere time is precious so try to be as selective as possible with the activities that you choose to pursue and make sure they re really worth the investment on a related note don t underestimate the importance of down time or me time allotting time in your schedule for self reflection is healthy use networking and social media to your advantage actively pursue and study the industry in which you want to be involved even if it s not the one you re currently working within hiring managers are more likely to open and review a resume that is passed along by a client friend or peer so take a look at your network and

loves the cloud price wars for now,for consumers the recent price war over storage has been a pleasant surprise for internet companies though it s been a cause for an extended wave of high fives â œone of my ceos declared to me the other day that last week s activity in the cloud may have been one of the most important weeks in technology history but we won t realize it for many years to come â wrote jeff bussgang a general partner at venture capital firm flybridge capital why specialization is a powerful economic force it fueled the industrial revolution and it has quietly transformed the digital world humans once did all their farming and building themselves much like startups used to build out their own infrastructure this was a necessary but not particularly efficient system as farmers and blacksmiths emerged to generate more labor through specialization so have specialized cloud computing and services become the backbone that fuels startups and fortune companies alike netflixâ s interface operates on amazon web services aws and has no plans of leaving a spokesperson said which is why last week s announcements of price cuts to the cloud services of google and amazon two of the most widely used cloud services resonated across the internet the price is right picturelife a startup that organizes usersâ picture and videos relies on amazon cloud services and its bills started piling up when google dropped its prices the company began to consider a switch â œwe doubled the size of our photo archive and therefore our database as well then we started to see that this can be really expensive â said nate westheimer cofounder and ceo of picturelife opens in a new window â œwe knew it would be and we started to reassess some of our architectural decisions and look for ways to cut costs â the next day amazon dropped its prices too picturelife stayed with amazon which westheimer said played a critical role in the company from the start westheimer said he doesn t believe he could have created a company if cloud services like amazon s didn t exist amazon is best known as an e commerce giant that also dabbles in media among web businesses it serves a very different role amazon web services is the industrial farmer of the internet a cloud based service that takes care of the arduous but necessary tasks that once cost startups large chunks of their capital demand for this type of service has produced a market with no shortage of options google and microsoft offer similar services while dropbox and box lead a raft of smaller companies prices for consumers are low with most services offering a certain amount of free storage to individuals users while still cheaper than building its own infrastructure cloud services do get expensive in a blog post westheimer pointed to everpix opens in a new window another photo storage startup that eventually ran up a bill with amazon that it couldn t pay forcing the company to close its doors stronger better faster cheaper two important factors precipitated the price cut growing competition between established players and plenty of new entrants into the market along with improvements in technology that lowered the operating cost for service providers â œwe knew was coming they re very large companies that have continued to innovate over time and that s what makes them so successful â said mitch wainer cofounder and chief marketing officer of cloud services startup digitalocean â œthe prices were a little too high knowing the business side of infrastructure i know what their margins were in ballpark range and they had plenty of room to cut back they knew they could cut back and still be profitable â digitialocean opens in a new window is one of a variety of cloud startups seeking its niche the company targets developers that want complex features in a simplified interface other companies like stackdriver opens in a new window sprung up around the space to help monitor cloud services falling prices are great for consumers and companies but savings can be fleeting growing companies can rapidly increase reliance on services leaving them victims of their own success yuri sagalov cofounder and ceo of personal cloud startup aerofs said mounting data needs will offset falling costs â œi think that the price of storage is continually going down but at the same time the amount of data we re creating is exploding â said sagalov who is also a part time partner at y combinator â œten years ago there were so few companies that had petabyte storage arrays â you get what you pay for falling prices call into question whether the quality of the services will remain at the same level a christmas eve problem with aws caused an outage of netflix and other customers while startups may be without other options for services larger companies that are built on a single service rely heavily on the cloud provider i can only assume both aws and google are going to offset the price drop by further over subscription of their services to maintain margins â said lance crosby ceo of softlayer ibmâ s cloud infrastructure service in an email â œthe financial benefit will be erased by the performance degradation leaving the customer at status quo â for now internet companies will enjoy a little more cash in their pockets but if cloud prices continue to drop the market could risk underpricing itself and minimizing necessary competition box which now trades publicly operates at a loss having generated million in revenue in its last fiscal year resulting in a loss of million the company has said it does not expect to be profitable opens in a new window in the near term as it continues to invest in the fast growing competitive market raghu kulkarni founder and ceo of idrive opens in a new window among the oldest cloud storages companies around said price drops are a good thing but they can turn ugly if companies focus only on taking market share â œoverall it s a helpful thing from a consumer perspective it s a great thing â he said â œwhat one needs to be careful is about the extent of these drops if someone is doing this just for the sake of gaining market share at a loss with an eye on the future i think that s a dangerous game to play â,0

future of email the internet s least exciting application,email is not sexy that is to say the design and functionality of electronic mail since its inception have remained fundamentally consistent and relatively unexciting we type out messages send them to our contacts and wait for a reply in years that foundation will still exist but we ll likely have a lot more options see also chain emails that haunted your youth according to experts such as yesware opens in a new window founder matthew bellows the time for email to expand and innovate is now there was an idea that email was dead a few years ago bellows tells mashable that s just not true obviously though competing messaging platforms and other options have come and gone email has remained perhaps the primary use of the internet since it began when gmail entered the mix years ago the seeds of evolution were planted now email seems due for another great change we reached out to developers and designers like bellows to see what those changes will look like and how they ll affect the way we send and receive email the dawn of third party applications currently most major email providers do not expressly support third party applications this makes it challenging for other companies beyond the provider to increase the usefulness of email as a whole for users with niche needs for bellows and the team at yesware whose tool is built on top of preexisting email providers to allow users simpler solutions to common business problems this fact makes it difficult to grow we re kind of hacked in right now bellows says every time gmail changes we have to change according to bellows email providers would be wise to encourage more and easier third party programming he believes that when facebook launched its facebook platform for third party development in the value of its service exploded users could go to facebook for niche interests such as gaming and all facebook had to do was open the door users stayed on facebook longer third party developers had an easier time reaching customers and your over sharing aunt was able to play farmville to her heart s content the email game conquer your email opens in a new window from baydin inc opens in a new window on vimeo opens in a new window in years bellows sees third party development exploding on email services like gmail i don t think against it i think it s a matter of priority for them says bellows i think it says something that in the meantime they haven t shut us down gmail product manager alex gawley doesn t disagree with bellows prediction but sees third party development happening in different ways it s less about third party devs building on top of gmail than building within the emails that they send gawley tells mashable to him the future will be about senders putting richer information within emails package tracking data surveys etc rather than building apps to improve the service itself smarter input history and management what s going to be constant is this we will be sending each other electronic messages and we will have way too many of them bellows says according to him the usefulness of speech recognition tools such as the iphone s siri have yet to be fully developed in the future he believes more of us will send emails through voice input programs rather than keyboards pointing to google glass as an example bellows sees email adjusting and adapting to innovative new tech in ways that for now remain largely speculative augmented intelligence bellows says will help us figure out what to say along with whom to say it to and our conversation histories will more adequately inform us about whom we speak to and and how we know them all of this it seems will help to increase the productivity of the ever increasing pool of digital workers personalized design kevin fox former user experience design lead at google and the original creator of the gmail interface sees the future of email design evolving on a similar path to that of the greater web email is so much the lowest common denominator in terms of design fox tells mashable lots of communication that would ve been done through email years ago is now being done through chat social networks and texting more than ever there is reason for email providers to start thinking seriously about design to fox this means a greater focus on message building similar to twitter bios or facebook cover photos fox believes the emails you compose in the future will have more user personality included according to fox message composing could adapt a system somewhat similar to pre built template documents creating greater ease in messaging depending on whom you re communicating with large user growth through mobile approximately billion people will be using email in years according to bellows as more of the world s population gets connected the need for innovation and structural changes will only grow experts agree that most of those users will come from mobile mobile usage is growing very fast that s why we ve invested so heavily in it gawley says that s certainly where we see a lot of growth according to fox the increase in mobile use will likely lead to more ways users can send emails email on mobile devices is more of a reading tool he says you ll compose a message if you have to but it ll be shorter and there ll be mistakes fox believes more and more emails will be created in ways other than through simply opening a compose window typing up a message while the future of email is largely hypothetical at this point in time it seems clear that it will finally get a bit more exciting,0

number could reach or more the majority of the victims killed in the crashes were young and many of them were women all of whom were driving small entry level cars like the chevrolet cobalt and the saturn ion for some of them these were their first cars the defect is a result of a faulty ignition switch that causes cars to suddenly switch off this then stiffens the brakes causes a loss of power

google fumbled glass and how to save it,hey is that google glass the question came from a man on new york city s fifth avenue as i rushed to a meeting he was correct the blue apparatus on my face was indeed google glass which i hadn t worn in public for a while when i wore it for several periods during passers by would typically wait a little longer before asking about it they were usually excited this was different the man s tone was urgent almost accusatory yes i answered not stopping mainly because i was late for my meeting but also because something felt off about the exchange man that s scary unsure of how to respond i muttered a semi sarcastic thanks it s not a compliment he barked before turning and walking off the other way that was new i d been shot the occasional suspicious look while wearing google glass never out and out hostility as the drive by heckling reverberated in my head i couldn t help but think about the now infamous google glass incident that had happened recently at a bar in san francisco where patrons apparently irate at being potentially recorded and then actually recorded appear to have harassed and robbed a woman wearing glass with one of them snatching the device right off her face while the full picture of what happened during that particular episode remains in dispute and the woman sarah slocum has hardly helped her case by trying to parlay her minutes of fame into free trips from google opens in a new window the incident became a watershed moment in the life of google glass it was an indicator that public sentiment toward the device has taken a turn for the worse perhaps irrevocably it didn t have to be this way sure any connected device that puts a camera on a person s body automatically invites some kind of backlash but google despite its good intentions released glass in a very unusual manner and has stumbled along the way you can trace back many of the image problems glass is experiencing now to key decisions made earlier in the rollout so where did it all go wrong cracked glass for evidence of the problem you don t have to look farther than google itself type the term google glass is in google autocomplete to see what most people are searching for on the topic it s not a pretty picture credit google if you peruse the comment threads opens in a new window on anything written about the slocum encounter you d think glass was not just to blame for provoking the barfight but also for san francisco s gentrification issues the eroding of privacy in general and possibly the coming war with the machines at least one restaurant has banned glass opens in a new window because of the incident and others were doing it already slocum wasn t even officially a glass explorer at the time although google later extended an invitation but the damage done is indisputable even some of glass s strongest advocates are souring on it robert scoble probably the earliest and most enthusiastic glass explorer has been trashing the connected headset lately first ripping apart the device itself opens in a new window and later google s entire strategy around it opens in a new window all sorts of things are broken like you can only put contacts into so using it as a phone accessory sucks scoble told mashable adding that google s biggest mistake surrounding glass has been in communication has certainly hurt it in the press i just don t have that many bad reactions in public what is really wrong is it is so broken that it is hard to be positive about it with others as an explorer myself i feel scoble s pain even if i don t agree with all his criticisms i like that glass is designed explicitly to not keep you as connected as a smartphone i also share scoble s enthusiasm after using glass for a while i ve seen the amazing potential of the technology but watching incidents like slocum s barfight take hold of the narrative has been a painful experience with each complaint it becomes harder not to admit there s something to what opponents are saying google hasn t been sitting on its hands the company published a pretty good guide to wearing glass without being called a glasshole opens in a new window it continues the attempt to manage expectations most recently by dispelling myths about glass mainly the ones that creep people out like exactly what that camera s doing and pointing out that glass is currently a prototype not a finished product fair enough but the mere fact that google needs to play damage control confirms that the tenor of the discussion around google glass has changed and not for the better the excitement surrounding sergey brin s daring glass inspired skydiving stunt at google i o is a distant memory glass in has become an emblem for technology s worst stereotypes ultra geeky expensive and worst of all privacy destroying the fashion factor the first mistake google made with glass came before anyone even knew about it a key decision was made in the production of glass that it should stand out not blend in sure a connected headset requires something a little bulkier than your typical warby parker frames but google decided to a use an odd asymmetrical design and b offer it in five colors if an explorer selects either sky or tangerine glass doesn t just stand out it screams glass earned unfavorable comparisons to other weird looking tech well known industrial designer marc newson recently said he wouldn t be caught dead wearing it complaining glass makes the user look like a complete dick in the same way the segway did that s precisely the moment when i think the fashion world laughs at the world of industrial design justifiably he told dezeen opens in a new window giving glass a touch of flamboyance was understandable every manufacturer wants its signature products to get noticed the design guaranteed glass would turn heads but it also ensured no one could be neutral about it the future was here sitting on someone s face and it was instantly on trial you either were intrigued and enthralled by the potential of an always connected headset or like neil gaiman you just thought it looked very very silly the design itself isn t bad evan ryan an industrial designer with ecco told mashable but it doesn t look right as a thing you wear every day it doesn t even look within the realm of some of the outlandish fashion styles you might see in new york city the ostentatious design had a secondary effect it ensured glass s earliest ambassadors would be people who wanted to be noticed these aren t the soccer moms and guitarists we saw in the earliest promo videos opens in a new window for glass sharing clips and getting directions to the nearest cool food truck no the people introducing glass to the world are digital marketers consultants and bloggers people more likely to use glass for a reality show opens in a new window or advertising campaign opens in a new window than logging their everyday moments this was confirmed to me when i attended a google glass explorer meetup in new york city last fall looking to get developers impressions of glass i instead got a cavalcade of self promotional characters each weirder than the last when an ambitious teenager with excruciatingly bad breath tried to tell me he wanted to become the first person to win political office with a glass powered campaign i didn t know whether to laugh or laugh really loudly any obsession can be blinding and with technology the idea of becoming superhuman can be very intoxicating says jonas damon a designer with frog design being under the spell of this promise we forget how obtrusive a chunky piece of hardware on our heads can be that person sees non stop access to data that is the person who wears google glass recruiting some epically bad ambassadors for glass was google s next mistake the company did it via the ifihadglass campaign this seemed like a genius move at the time get people to tell you how they d use glass then send headsets to the ones who make the most promising and creative suggestions the goal of ifihadglass was to get glass into the hands of people from all walks of life ed sanders google s director of marketing for google glass told mashable sure there have been some controversial moments and you can choose to focus on those few but there are thousands of explorers out there and broadly speaking we ve been amazed and inspired by them this is exactly what we were after when we started the explorer program and we haven t been disappointed from the looks of things at that meetup however google may as well have used the hashtag weirdosunite having a creative idea about google glass isn t the same as executing it and it certainly doesn t guarantee an appropriate ambassadorial personality google correctly points out that not everyone is doing a google glass reality show and that many developers are doing worthwhile and technically impressive things with the device but standing out from the crowd is part of the deal and a large number of glass explorers clearly see the device as a ticket to notoriety developing long google has certainly given glass users enough time to get noticed the device itself was unveiled in spring the company sent out its first units in april a year later the commercial release of google glass is still nowhere on the horizon officially there s no release date although brin has said in interviews that is the target according to google this was the plan all along we had two choices design glass in a secret conference room somewhere with zero input from the outside world or design it in the open with the help from our explorers and the wider public sanders said we believe the latter is the right approach because it gives us the opportunity to build a device that reflects how people use it in the real world gmail was in beta for years as engineers worked to make it a fantastic email platform this phase of glass can be messy and imperfect but the final result in the long term is worth it the gmail comparison works up to a point unlike gmail glass is also a new category one that forces questions about social acceptance and privacy it s also in limited supply and you have to pay for the privilege even if you score an invite gmail s beta was free and invites were much easier to come by every gmail user started with of them it also wasn t something you could wear on a date the privacy concerns around glass aren t baseless although the camera technology of glass is no different from a smartphone s the fact that the camera rests on your face changes everything the first question most people ask when they approach me about glass is are you recording me the toluna group a market research firm recently surveyed consumer reactions to glass in multiple countries the survey of people some results below found that fears about private actions becoming public in the presence of google glass was a common theme and that many people of respondents in the u k were concerned about what glass meant for privacy credit toluna there are a lot of cameras out there says bob gellman a washington d c based privacy consultant but being photographed by individuals is kind of a different thing it s not some screaming violation of everything but it s the difference between talking to a reporter on the record or off the record when the camera s on you re on the record all the time whether you know it or not putting the camera in full view on a garish gadget was supposed to quell any fears about glass as a privacy violating device it has actually had the opposite effect google made glass the only digital camera left that doesn t use opens in a new window facial recognition technology but even that hasn t silenced the critical voices of privacy advocates a lot of people donâ t recognize google glass and donâ t necessarily know what its capabilities are says gellman whatever they are they could easily become less transparent as the technology gets better and smaller i think the word that applies here is creepy those concerns have been exacerbated by the fact that glass is still only in the hands of around people even now a year after the launch and two years after it was first unveiled many people still regard glass as spyware and at least one developer has obliged them by creating an app opens in a new window that offers no indication when glass is taking photos australia is even thinking of overhauling its privacy laws opens in a new window in the wake of glass this is a perfect illustration of the bind google finds itself in misinformation and exaggerated reports would be easier to shoot down if glass were a real product with millions of units in circulation but google is clearly tiptoeing here not so much testing whether glass is ready for customers but whether society is ready for glass google has already been dinged over privacy and now has the ftc looking over its shoulder for the next two decades it has inadvertently annoyed various industries for making wrongheaded assumptions about major products such as google tv which irritated content providers having learned its lessons google is being particularly careful with the glass rollout perhaps too careful the excruciatingly long timeframe is allowing critics and incidents like the bar assault to take hold of the product s narrative for every firefighter opens in a new window or doctor opens in a new window who does something innovative with glass someone is pulled over while driving with the device or gets thrown out of a movie theater and interrogated by the fbi opens in a new window for wearing it google may have made the right decision in developing glass in public but the conspicuous design the ifihadglass campaign and the excruciatingly long road to a consumer launch were all self inflicted wounds a new pane dawns there s still time to make this right google s deal with luxottica tying the device to a well known consumer eyewear brand is a step in the right direction getting ray ban to make frames for google glass doesn t nullify privacy issues but it does increase the desirability factor another good step would be to better control who s actually getting glass pre launch google needs to give out memberships to the glass club in a manner more like el al airlines and less like oprah and you get a glass and you get a glass let s have no more consultants reality show creators or wannabe politicians not until everyone can buy it credit mashable even better more google personnel should be advocates for glass robert scoble criticized larry page when he appeared recently at ted for not wearing glass and it s hard not to see his point if glass really does improve someone s digital life and look stylish why isn t google s own ceo wearing it defenders might say the device isn t appropriate all the time but at some point this lack of visibility on google s most visible faces starts to come across as a lack of confidence finally google should rethink the design particularly its initial decision to make glass conspicuous that made the device a lightning rod for privacy fears and ensured only a self selecting few would take part in google s head mounted wearable adventure true glass that looks more like a regular pair of glasses may garner more criticism from privacy advocates but anyone actually interested in the benefits of the technology would breathe a sigh of relief knowing they wouldn t necessarily have to act as an ambassador every time they put them on in public maybe even neil gaiman would try them the design of glass has changed many times in the last two years and it will continue to change sanders said two years ago it was a couple of cell phone boards hot glue gunned to wireframe glasses today it weighs about as much as a pair of sunglasses and with luxottica onboard explorers can expect even more design choices in the months ahead to be completely clear i really like google glass i usually wear it when i play with my kids to ensure i capture wonderful fleeting moments without needing to aim or focus anything with my hands i wear it in public often i like talking to people about it and if there s time showing them the benefits of a connected headset and the benefits are many seeing messages but only essential ones the instant they come in keeps me in the loop with people i care about having voice activated access to google anytime anywhere has let me get answers to quick questions the kind i d never have bothered to pull out my smartphone to ask the way it does turn by turn directions is a dream especially in the car however as much as i d like to dismiss the bars that have banned glass the fbi agents who detained the man who wore glass to a movie theater and the gentleman who yelled at me on the street as paranoid cranks i have to admit their concerns have some merit google glass looks weird a lot of weirdos are wearing it and there s that camera google has to change the conversation and fast if it doesn t the promise of google glass and other smart glasses like it will probably be eclipsed by smartwatches which are experiencing a surge in interest if apple s rumored iwatch is available to consumers before glass google is going to have a much harder time convincing people that they should experience on their faces the same sort of thing that looks more stylish on their wrists smart glasses still have a shot at becoming mainstream wearable technology if google really wants glass to be part of our future it needs to put on its connected headset and lead we can see the vision now s not the time to blink,1

is hft what you should know about high frequency trading,if you ve scratched your head this week about all the talk around high frequency trading you re not alone high frequency trading a practice that has become increasingly common in recent years has gained more mainstream attention thanks in large part to michael lewis the author of popular books like moneyball and the big short his new book released monday is called flash boys opens in a new window and takes a critical look at the risks of high speed trading it has already sparked some heated debates as you can see in the incredible cnbc video below at the same time the fbi recently confirmed opens in a new window that it is looking into the practice of high speed trading to determine whether traders are breaking the law by having access to non public information to help explain what high frequency trading is how we got to this point and why the government is taking notice we reached out to charles jones a finance professor at columbia business school here is a lightly edited transcript of that conversation mashable first things first can you give us a brief explainer on how high frequency trading works jones it s a computer program that is programmed to trade in and out of stocks pretty quickly with holding periods measured usually in seconds to minutes rather than in days and weeks these guys are doing a couple of different things they are the new market makers they are willing to buy and hold onto the shares for a few minutes until they can find another buyer who wants to hold it longer term they are also often trading on small imperfections where prices aren t exactly the same in two markets so how did we get to this point where we can speed up and automate trades we ve been transitioning from manual markets with trading floors and people to automated markets where it s basically a computer server somewhere in suburban new jersey that process has been going on for really the last years more or less the computers won and when the computers won everybody had to revamp all their processes to deal with the new ecosystem so that s why the high frequency trading program has replaced the floor trader on the floor of the stock exchange an algorithm for a pension fund for it to place its orders has replaced a broker who would spend all day to slowly buy shares who are the big players here would the average person even recognize the names all the exchanges have embraced it the real changing of the guard here is that it used to be dominated by large wall street firms and their trading desks they have been supplanted by these newer companies that are more technology companies than they are wall street companies the players now are mostly names that people have never heard of companies like getco companies like citadel companies like tradeworx these are typically small technology shops that have very fast hardware and good code what is the strongest case in favor of the practice of high speed trading if we replace a lot of humans with computer code we are going to be able to do that cheaper it s wringing costs out of the system and when you wring costs out of the system you can basically provide the same services to investors at lower costs the pro case especially if you are a retail trader is you are actually a lot better off now because these guys are able to provide liquidity at lower cost you will never pay more than a penny extra a share in markup now commissions are or some number like that for any size trade the technology squeezes the cost out and the competition squeezes the profit out and the investor benefits and what is the case against it the con case is really that it s possible the markets are more fragile than they were before that because it s all computers talking to each other and the quality control isn t always there we are prone to maybe more breakdowns than before there have been a few high profile examples opens in a new window of that the fbi is currently looking into high frequency trading the sec had previously proposed regulations what s going on here i think it s clear that hft has a serious perception problem even if perception is worse than the reality so i think these guys are responding to that given the outcry and worry by some investors it probably makes sense to look more closely and make sure there isn t any there there the new michael lewis book has certainly helped propel the issue more into the mainstream what if anything do you expect will come from that i think what it means is this is elevating the discussion it will elevate the importance of these policy issues the sec might not have been too keen to have looked at the overall u s market structure but you can be damn sure they are going to now my guess is that that s going to happen before is out,1

build windows update cloud mania and more,microsoft will play host to thousands of developers partners and press at its annual build conference this week the company and newbie ceo satya nadella have a lot on the agenda covering everything from windows to office to devices didn t we just do this build comes just nine months after the previous one and that conference which saw a change of venue from redmond wash to san francisco was a mere nine months after build it s no accident that microsoft is putting the pedal to the metal the company would say the accelerated schedule represents the way of the world now with rapid fire updates and a near constant churn of new apps and services move fast and break things is much more than just a facebook slogan these days but in microsoft s case there s more to it than that the company is playing both catch up and damage control its smartphone and tablet platforms came later than its competitors and the bold strategy surrounding touch friendly windows and later didn t really work out as planned pc sales have continued to slide and most of the people who led that launch have left the company not to mention there s a new man at the top nadella who replaced the polarizing steve ballmer will kick off the proceedings in the opening day keynote wednesday morning with this crowd though it s not a big leap nadella has led the day keynote for the past few years and he ll be in his element in front of an audience of developers most of whom are as in love with the cloud as he is but this time as ceo nadella is also playing to a mainstream crowd too the company may be making reams of cash but its influence on everyday computing is still on the wane he ll need to convince observers that microsoft can fix its platform issues while exciting them about what s still to come here s what some of that might entail windows update microsoft s most substantive announcement the windows update has already leaked it includes many new features almost all of them to improve the experience for mouse and keyboard setups the desktop and the taskbar regain their prominence on those machines and the default setting boots the user into the desktop the changes represent what will probably be the last and most essential course correction on the path microsoft embarked on with windows from the start the os was criticized for going too far with touch windows on traditional machines where the user would typically spend the most time in the desktop anyway the changes might not silence all the critics but it may win over a few more upgrades particularly among microsoft s crucial business customers windows upgrade for free in march a rumor circulated that microsoft may offer a version of windows that would be a free download for users running windows or earlier the catch would be that the software would be powered if not sponsored by bing it s unclear exactly how that would work but amazon s ad supported kindles may provide the template however there s a chance that the rumor is just that although a screenshot surfaced of a pc running windows with bing it s possible it was just an experiment or meant something else entirely office for touch windows preview microsoft unveiled office for ipad last week and at that event nadella said the company would have more to say about office on other platforms at build a version of office that runs in the modern metro environment made a closed door appearance at last year s conference but there are big technical leaps to actually convert it which is why the current version still runs in the desktop most likely we ll see a preview and possibly a release date for touch office but not much more if modern office was close to launch microsoft probably would have released it with the ipad version windows phone moves forward the last windows phone update gave the platform phablets and the next one said to be called windows phone will give it a voice assistant according to leaks opens in a new window codenamed cortana the update will put windows phone in the same league as ios and android which have had sophisticated voice control for years also rumored to be part of the update vpn support internet explorer and an overhauled camera interface the first phones may hit as early as late april by then nokia may even be officially part of microsoft azure bing and onedrive the unsung heroes of build have always been microsoft s services but now they ll likely get some extra play for a couple of reasons first nadella has put the cloud front and center in microsoft s game plan and second they re actually pretty good these days after a slight rebranding microsoft s azure cloud now matches amazon web services pricing onedrive the most public facing service is now intimately tied with windows and the tools it offers such as cheap cloud storage and real time collaboration work well and bing s data continues to spread to more apps since microsoft opened it up to developers last year surface mini when microsoft refreshed its surface lineup last fall something was missing a small size tablet windows enables smaller form factors and several have appeared on the market since its release will microsoft s house mini tablet finally arrive at build rumors opens in a new window say the surface mini will get its big unveiling at the conference and that may happen but considering the lack of substantive leaks the release date will probably be later in the year possibly the summer sings of windows with the windows update microsoft takes windows about as far as it can go in terms of pleasing critics it s also been about a year and a half since its initial release the halfway point if the previous two versions of windows vista and are any indication microsoft has certainly begun work on windows or whatever it ends up being called but it s still a bit early for any major announcements windows made its official pubic appearance at the summer computex show in taiwan in and that was still a very early look microsoft may repeat that pattern or it may hold another event in the fall assuming it keeps the same three year schedule could mining that doesn t mean we won t get hints of where the company is going with all this among all the product announcements nadella will set a tone and lay out a vision for what microsoft will do and more important what it will represent to technology in the coming years where steve ballmer saw devices and services nadella sees cloud and mobile it s basically the same thing but subtly different note the order of the terms nadella s microsoft puts new emphasis on the power of our devices to connect us to apps data media and the wonders emerging from minds of silicon valley and beyond it sounds straightforward but it s the most challenging thing and that goes double for microsoft since it needs to get its house in order while simultaneously building a new one to better serve this connected future can it do both we ll have a better idea by the end of the week,0

back on a decade of gmail,i still remember where i was when i first heard about gmail it was april and i was at my parents house recovering from having my wisdom teeth removed at and finishing my third year of college most of my recovery consisted of listening to my ipod a third generation model and browsing the internet if you replace livejournal with tumblr slashdot with reddit and hacker news and gawker with well gawker the open tabs in my browser firefox in google chrome today aren t that different gmail was the news story that day i remembering discussing it in ims with friends and on livejournal google a company we then only knew as a search engine was launching its own mail service and it was going to give of storage to all users for free because of this extraordinary claim and because it launched on april many of us thought it might be a hoax it s important to remember the state of free webmail as it existed in hotmail gave users of storage that s not a typo yahoo was a little better offering or depending on when you signed up moreover those services had fairly strict login requirements if you didn t check your mail within a certain number of days all of it was deleted and gone forever most serious email users either used whatever account came with their isp or hooked their webmail account to client software like outlook or apple mail that worked fine but meant that most users could only access email on one machine i could check my email on my laptop but unless i had my pop settings configured just right it wouldn t sync up with my inbox if you had a smartphone i had a treo in that was yet another hurdle or another email address gmail was radically different google s mantra was that you would have enough space to never need to delete email ever again the design of gmail was different too rather than putting stuff in folders you applied tags you searched rather than filing things away messages were displayed as conversations and threads rather than individual messages this seems obvious now as good ideas usually do but in april it was a brand new way to think about email as harry mccracken notes in his history of gmail opens in a new window the launch of gmail marks the birth of the modern web the allure of the invite everyone in my circle of friends wanted access to gmail but to ensure that the product could scale appropriately google limited its rollout to get an account early on you needed an invite to get an invite you needed to be in the technology media or know someone at google as google knew one of the side benefits of scaling in a controlled way was that it created a greater sense of demand just hours after google issued a press releasing announcing gmail invites became the ultimate score for tech aficionados such as myself trading forums popped up invites made their way onto ebay at least until ebay blocked invite sales and in an era before facebook extended past the ivy league tech savvy users scoured their networks to try to find a way in i knew a few people at google but none of them well enough to bug for an invite fortunately my friend ryan had a good friend at google and he managed to score an invite the day gmail launched after continuous prodding ryan was able to send me an invite a few days later on april i created my account and logged in for the first time gmail message from april credit the age of ads ten years later it would be easy to look back on the gmail launch as a smashing success indeed in many ways it was the product itself was remarkably well built it went on to really define the idea of a web app proved that ajax would not only work but would be the future and helped define google as more than just a search company still gmail faced criticism as soon as it launched gmail launched with ads but not just any ads contextual ads generated in part by the contents of your email google released adsense in by it was starting to make itself at home across the web the genius of gmail was that it would apply adsense technology to the content of a user s inbox google was quick to point out that humans never read the messages and the matching of ads to content was performed entirely by computers never by people still privacy advocates were on high alert within the first week of gmail s launch petitions were written lawsuits were threatened and it seemed like the issue might kill gmail in its crib writing for slate in april opens in a new window paul boutin came out against gmail critics arguing that the privacy fears were silly but he also acknowledged that not handling them correctly could cost the company dearly they may be forced to abandon the best web mail system yet because of a few well placed people who ve never even tried it he wrote that really would be evil it turned out boutin had nothing to fear most users just didn t care i remember discussing the gmail privacy issue with friends in the first few weeks the service was available the algorithmic nature of gmail s ad platform put many of us at ease others were willing to accept a potential lack of privacy in exchange for a free service that was so much better than anything else in web email still what ultimately reassured all of us even those with bigger picture concerns was the fact that we trusted google we trusted google to do the right thing by its users and to respect our privacy in april four months before it went public google was the tech company i most admired in a tech world still battered from the scars of the dotcom crash google seemed fresh and clean and futuristic it s interesting to see just how long that lasted for years i predicted a google backlash if only because of the sheer amount of data the company was collecting and yet it took until with the bungled launch of google buzz for the narrative around google to shift even now in when google s mammoth cache of user data and analytics is second only to the nsa sentiment around the company is largely positive i no longer see google as the ideal tech company frankly aspects of the company and its products creep me out but i still use google services every single day a decade later i don t have the same trust that google will do the right thing by its users but i still trust that it won t make decisions out of malice ten years of gmail a few fun email facts by the numbers the number of emails in my original gmail account from april the number of emails in my mashable google apps account since august number of unread messages in my mashable inbox the number of distinct google apps

survey reveals depth of california s water woes,after its third driest winter on record driest calendar year and third straight year of below average precipitation california water officials were no doubt bracing for bad news when they set out to conduct a statewide snow survey high in the sierra nevada mountain range on april the snow survey is seen as a key marker of the health of the state s water supplies since it typically marks the peak snow cover for the season snow surveyors found a snowpack on tuesday that contains just of the average water content typically observed at this time of year which places as among the lowest water content years on record since such records began in the low water content combined with unusually low reservoir levels means that the country s most populous state faces a long and stressful dry season ahead with farmers and their thirsty crops competing with urban residents for access to increasingly scarce supplies the california agriculture industry is the largest of any state in the u s generating about billion in annual revenue and the drought is projected to hit farmers especially hard we re already seeing farmland fallowed and cities scrambling for water supplies mark cowin director of the california department of water resources said in a statement we can hope that conditions improve but time is running out and conservation is the only tool we have against nature s whim california has been mired in a historic drought for more than a year part of a broader multi year drought that is also affecting other states in the west it had its warmest and third driest winter on record which intensified the preexisting drought following the state s driest calendar year on record in as of march all of california was in some form of drought condition with exceptional drought gripping about of the state the drought is the most severe one year drought on record in california even more severe than the drought to find a comparable drought you have to go back to events that took place before instrument records began in the late century snowpack measurement on april is often considered a key measure of where we are peter gleick president of the oakland based environmental research group pacific institute told reporters on a conference call â œby any measures our snowpack is low recent storms have helped boost california s water supplies slightly and forecasts show additional wet weather is possible opens in a new window in parts of the state during the next two weeks however precipitation on a scale that would be required to end the drought is not likely until next fall or winter electronic readings from the california department of water resources found that the central parts of the sierra nevada have the most snow with snowpack water content of normal this compares to of average for the northern mountains and of normal for the south runoff from mountain snowpack contributes about one third of california s water supply with the rest coming from reservoirs or piped in from out of state according to the world resources institute a washington think tank california draws water from million acres of land across eight states making matters worse reservoirs are also running far below average levels for this time of year another sign of the water stress that california will grapple with this summer lake oroville in butte county which is the state water project s largest reservoir is at only of its capacity and san luis reservoir which contributes water to the state water project opens in a new window and the central valley project opens in a new window is at just of its capacity the department of water resources said responding to the drought conditions water suppliers including the state have been slashing their promised deliveries on jan the state water project which supplies supplemental water to nearly million californians and acres of irrigated farmland set its water delivery estimate at zero which if it remains at that level would be the first time that has happened in the year history of the project in addition the department of water resources also said it planned to reduce allocations to farmland by the maximum extent allowable by law santa clara valley water district which supplies water for much of silicon valley has instituted a mandatory reduction in water use to below levels after a series of water delivery cutbacks from state and federal agencies the role of climate change in the current drought is complicated since natural variability in the climate system has brought more severe and far longer lasting droughts to the west in the past however a new report from the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change and other data show that increased temperatures help dry out soils faster and melt more snow thereby acting as a drought amplifier â œwe know that climate change is contributing to the current drought â pacific institute s gleick said â œclimate change now influences extreme events and will continue to do so â,0

to be ready in advance by marking your calendar and highlighting a number of these special dates april and mars closest approach in and a total eclipse of the moon during the overnight hours of april and it will be a night for viewing first mars and later the full moon first mars will come to within million miles of our planet making its closest approach to us since jan all through the night mars will resemble a dazzling star shining with a steady fiery colored tint making it a formidable sight its brightness will match sirius the brightest of all the stars as a bonus later that very same night actually during the early hours of april north america will have a ringside seat to see a total lunar eclipse opens in a new window when the full moon becomes transformed into a mottled reddish ball for minutes as it becomes completely immersed in the shadow of the earth this total lunar eclipse will be the first one widely visible from north america in nearly years the americas will have the best view of this eclipse although over the canadian maritimes moonset will intervene near the end of totality of special interest is the fact that the moon opens in a new window will appear quite near to the bright star spica in the constellation virgo during the eclipse they actually will be in conjunction a couple of hours prior to the onset of totality but they re still relatively near to each other when the eclipse gets underway april the lyrid meteor shower rather favorable circumstances are expected for this year s lyrid meteor shower opens in a new window predicted to be at maximum

we kill four lions for the sake of the pride,a wave of fresh outrage spread across the globe in march after the copenhagen zoo now infamous for killing a healthy month old giraffe just over a month ago culled four lions to make room for a new male who they hope will start a new pride but even more than outrage the killings have spurred conversation about how best to control animal populations in zoos european zoos like the one in copenhagen often favor euthanasia when a population gets out of control or becomes too genetically similar which puts the animals at risk of inbreeding zoos in europe don t have the range of options that american zoos have when it comes to moving animals to other locations that are more suitable many of them argue that euthanizing some animals is often better for the population as a whole because it allows grown animals to rear their offspring to a point copenhagen zoo is against birth control because it prevents animals from acting as they would in the wild opens in a new window see also copenhagen zoo kills lions weeks after giraffe controversy american zoos by and large favor contraception opens in a new window birth control may keep animals from breeding for a time but they argue that it is better to prevent breeding than allow an animal to be born when the zoo knows it will soon have no room for the animal in copenhagen zoo we let the animals breed naturally the zoo said in a statement opens in a new window posted on its website when officials killed marius the giraffe that means that the animals get to carry out their natural behaviors parental care is a big part of an animalâ s behavior later zoo officials added contraceptives have a number of unwanted side effects on the internal organs and we would therefore apply a poorer animal welfare if we did not euthanize â this means copenhagen zoo prefers to let its animals live as natural a life as possible in captivity free of birth control however this allows for the birth of animals that the zoo may not have room for or that may put the population at risk of inbreeding and often results in euthanasia the copenhagen zoo euthanizes around animals per year marius a male giraffe lies dead before being dissected after he was put down at copenhagen zoo on sunday feb credit polfoto peter hove olesen the european association of zoos and aquariums the governing body for those establishments across europe defended the zoo s choice opens in a new window to kill the lions in a statement opens in a new window on its website the zoo has been consistent in its approach to animal population management and high standards of animal welfare copenhagen zoo takes an approach that good welfare in the pride is stimulated and enhanced by natural cycles of reproduction and that cub rearing is an essential part of pride activity as a result while eaza regrets the death of the animals in question we recognize the right of copenhagen zoo to humanely cull them in line with their policies the zoo which declined to respond to our request for comment was trying to make room for a new male lion opens in a new window that would lead a younger pride and mate with two young lionesses two of the lions killed were older and the zoo said those lions would have tried to kill the new male because they would perceive him as a threat to their established pride the other two euthanized lions were cubs according to zoo officials the new male would have killed the cubs because male lions typically eliminate all sexually immature young that aren t their own offspring when they establish control of a new pride the reasoning is scientifically sound the young lionesses are the offspring of one of the older lions and keeping the older lion around would have risked inbreeding the new male assures genetic diversity zoo officials in the united states told mashable they understand the scientific validity of how the copenhagen zoo operates and that logically it is best to cull a few animals for the good of the larger number but u s officials also said they feel that the copenhagen zoo is failing to grasp how the public reacts to euthanasia of healthy animals we re zoos we re in the public eye said rick barongi director of the houston zoo if we say we care for animals and we have the highest standards of care you can t euthanize them others have questioned the reasoning behind the copenhagen zoo s euthanasia policy heather robertson a senior veterinarian at the nashville zoo said modern contraception doesn t necessarily decrease an animal s quality of life you look at all these years we ve spayed and neutered dogs or controlled populations in that way for more domestic animals and i don t think there s a decrease in the quality of life robertson said i understand what they re saying because you re taking that naturalistic drive that they would have but with non permanent controls you can reverse that and put them back in a breeding state the association of zoos and aquariums which oversees those american organizations declined to respond to a set of questions but it has been quick to point out that euthanasia is a last resort in the united states in a statement opens in a new window on its website it said the association of zoos and aquariums regrets the unfortunate incident at the copenhagen zoo involving the death of a giraffe incidents of that sort do not happen at aza accredited zoos and aquariums for several reasons those reasons are in part because aza accredited zoos carefully manage breeding programs according to the site and american zoos have a well developed animal exchange program that ensures the animals will have a home elsewhere a chimpanzee sits close to a window during his public debut at the houston zoo in december credit david j phillip still barongi and robertson acknowledge that finding a home for animals is more difficult for european zoos because regulations there prevent the zoos from transferring animals to private owners or zoos that are suitable but not accredited by an overseeing organization i don t think they have as many options over there but that said they should be

introduces fire tv set top box gaming console hybrid,amazon launched into the video hardware business on wednesday with a set top device called amazon fire tv for a small flat box with a remote control the hardware aims to take on the apple tv roku and even the xbox one the internet connected set top box which uses voice search when you speak into the remote and also serves as a gaming console was announced during a launch event in new york city on wednesday with amazon vp peter larsen playing master of ceremonies not ceo and founder jeff bezos the amazon fire tv which is not a dongle like the google chromecast device starts shipping today to check out the product click here opens in a new window the voice activated device aims to take away the frustrations of scrolling and clicking for letters on an alphabet grid to find content it also comes with a quad core processor gb of ram and a dedicated gpu for gaming purposes amazon said the fire tv is three times more powerful than the apple tv the remote control which resembles a hybrid of the apple tv remote and boxee s original remote is bluetooth based the gaming controller costs an additional credit fire tv is based on android and html which means it should be easy for companies to bring their apps over to the platform although it supports hulu plus netflix pandora youtube and crackle users will not be able to access hbo go and vudu however it will show you content available based on your subscriptions music can also be streamed via pandora iheartradio and vevo fire tv also serves as a predictive engine called asap which pre loads content it thinks you are going to watch so it can start without any buffering or load time this feature learns over time and gets better at suggesting content you like in a big move fire tv also serves as a gaming console and offers titles such as minecraft the walking dead and monsters university and many are free or as low as to play users will be able to play minecraft which allows for co op mode that will let users play with friends on their phones or tablets in the same environment â œwe wanted to build a streaming media device that allowed customers to play a variety of games at affordable prices a company spokesperson said during the event by next month thousands of games will be available for customers to play customers can use the fire tv remote and they can also use an app for phones or tablets as a controller there is also a dedicated game controller available as an accessory credit the move into video hardware doesn t come as a complete surprise last week amazon sent press invitations to the event that included an image of a couch with a bowl of popcorn nearby it was clear the announcement would involve its video business the theme also trickled into the design of the event space on wednesday which was set up to look like a living room amazon has decorated milk studios to look like a living room complete with couches amazonvideo opens in a new window in a new window â lance ulanoff lanceulanoff april opens in a new window amazon has been a leader in the e reader and tablet space for awhile so a move to tv set top boxes is a natural step for the company as it builds off of its video offerings although many set top boxes already have access to its prime instant video streaming library this allows amazon to ramp up its device collection while providing content directly to users plus it serves as new incentive for developers to create apps for amazon s kindle ecosystem amazon said it wants to close in on three key areas it wants to fix search performance and closed ecosystem the first set top box that supported amazon videos previously called amazon unbox was the tivo back in amazon video later came to roku devices in and the company rolled out prime instant video in bezos hinted a hardware device was in the works in september in an interview with mashable s lance ulanoff in a prior announcement made this weekend amazon said it will be turning six shows from its amazon originals program into a full series the shows which were selected after viewer feedback from the pilot episodes include the after bosch gortimer gibbonâ s life on normal street mozart in the jungle transparent and wishenpoof amazon also renewed alpha house starring john goodman for a second season amazon s prime instant video also became the exclusive subscription streaming home for the popular show pulling the series from netflix after years on the site the move comes just weeks before live another day returns to fox for a limited episode run starting may netflix users who planned to catch up on the series before it comes back to fox will have to turn to prime instant video to get their fill lance ulanoff and

fire tv questions and answers,amazonâ s fire tv video streaming set top box fulfilled most observers expectations itâ s hardware that supports amazonâ s existing prime video service netflix and a handful of other streaming options it plays music and games there really wasnâ t much we didnâ t know about the box before amazon vp peter larsen took the stage but by the time he was done we had a whole set of new questions i talked to larsen at the launch event and got a few answers for some of our most pressing questions who makes the amazon fire tvâ s graphics chip according to larsen itâ s a qualcomm arduino gpu that graphics horsepower comes as part of qualcommâ s snapdragon processor which as amazon explained during the unveiling is a quad core cpu often found in mobile device the and its graphics gpu support video stereo photography high speed usb and bluetooth is there a bundled deal for amazon fire tv and the fire game controller fire tv costs and the game controller costs itâ s conceivable many people will want to buy them together for now though a deal is not in the cards â œweâ re not announcing anything around that at this time â said larsen â œbut itâ s a good idea â do existing amazon prime customers get a deal on the new hardware no amazon prime customers already pay a year it used to be for free two day shipping and access to amazonâ s prime video content library they do get the first month of prime access free which means initial sign up is really a month deal said larsen we think itâ s a pretty great product for the price already â why didnâ t amazon ceo jeff bezos personally unveil fire tv bezos has a history of personally delivering the message on new product categories he did it for the first kindle and again for the first kindle fire tablet when amazonâ s new line of hd tablets came out bezos personally sat down with journalists this time no bezos â œwe like to mix it up â larsen said â œi know he loves thatâ s for sure â is amazon fire tv intended to compete with game consoles like the xbox one no even though this set top box has ample graphics horsepower and an admirable amount of memory gb of ram itâ s a casual gaming device the box includes gb of storage as little as an entry level iphone a game like call of duty is roughly gb and would eat up a quarter of the fire tv s storage space but the fire isn t geared towards that kind of gamer â œitâ s really apples and oranges â explained larsen â œthis isnâ t trying to compete against consoles â at all â can you expand the storage space during the launch amazon demonstrated the graphics rich mobile game asphalt running on fire tv but even that eats up almost of storage is there a way to store more than worth of games apparently so â œyou know it has a usb port on it â said larsen â œso we donâ t have anything specifically to announce there but itâ s a pretty good idea you could add a usb stick to it over time â what is asap how does it work and can you turn it off one of the more interesting features youâ ll find in amazon fire tv is asap which is more than just a content recommendation engine â œbasically asap predicts what youâ re most likely to watch larsen said it cues those tv shows and movies up so they start instantly this is far beyond the â œrecommendations for youâ you might find in netflix the recommendations are figured out on amazonâ s servers â œmost of our recommendations algorithms run up in the cloud as you might expect because weâ re applying it to a large catalog of content â can consumers turn this feature off no larsen said â œiâ m not sure why they would want to â why is there no store on fire tv the absence of an amazon retail destination on amazon fire tv is a surprise what better place to allow existing customers to do some couch based shopping sure they have their tablets and kindle fires do include a shopping destination but some might want retail therapy on the largest screen in their house â œitâ s a good idea and weâ re not going to talk about our future roadmap at this time said larsen but as you can expect we agree with you that itâ s an area ripe for innovation â does fire tv voice search work locally or access the amazon cloud amazon fire tv s bluetooth ready remote supports voice control for search credit mashable christina ascani amazonâ s fire tv includes what may be the first set top remote with voice control itâ s there primarily to help you find content how does it work remotely you speak and voice search pings amazonâ s servers for the answer whereâ s mayday last year amazon introduced a hour days a week live customer service platform on its hdx tablets amazon customers press the mayday icon on their tablet and almost immediately see live video of an amazon customer service representative seems like a perfect fit for a box that a lot of tech neophytes might buy no sadly there s no mayday on the amazon fire tv â for now â œitâ s a nice idea â said larsen who seemed to like all my ideas â œweâ re gonna watch what customers think and what theyâ re saying and telling us if they think itâ s an important feature weâ ll figure out a way to innovate on that over time do you get more cloud storage when you buy amazon fire tv an amazon account includes of free cloud storage you can buy more on an as needed basis during the product unveiling larsen showed how he could take a photo on his smartphone upload it to the amazon cloud and have it appear on his fire tv moments later that kind of functionality might encourage more people to use amazonâ s cloud storage unfortunately you wonâ t get any extra free cloud space with your new fire tv is the amazon fire tv hardware being sold at cost when i met with amazon ceo jeff bezos last year he outlined the companyâ s device strategy â œwe want to make money when people use our devices not when they buy devices â what that means amazon typically prices hardware so it can cover the costs of making it this helps make the hardware appealing for consumers and allows amazon to make more money when customers buy amazonâ s goods and services through these devices with amazon fire tv we are following that same strategy â said larsen â œthereâ s actually an unbelievable amount of technology in this product for â does adding yet another amazon device impact content access elsewhere no you can have as many

dressing rooms is really the ability to capture and share in real time with your friends â smith said facecakeâ s technology also allows consumers to compare two different looks side by side but now you can both see and share two entirely different looks side by side in real time and share those two looks with friends â œwhen given a choice between two necklaces or two dresses thereâ s always a

climate warnings exxon plans to burn through oil and gas reserves,on the same day that the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released its new report warning that global warming will raise the risks of a host of potentially costly and deadly consequences from sea level rise to food supply disruptions exxon mobil corp released its own set of climate reports opens in a new window as one might expect from the worldâ s most profitable corporation and one of the largest oil companies exxonâ s documents published monday struck a different tone from the ipcc exxonâ s reports to its shareholders amount to an unprecedented disclosure of how the company views its risk exposure to climate change specifically to potential greenhouse gas emissions reduction mandates that would curb oil and gas use between now and the year the company told its shareholders some of whom spent years trying to get the company to disclose its climate related risks that it does not need to plan for aggressive carbon emissions cuts before because governments are unlikely to impose such expensive regulations exxon cited a report by the international energy agency which found that it would cost up to trillion opens in a new window to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to below levels by this finding is striking because as the ipcc said just such aggressive emissions cuts are required in order for the world to limit manmade global warming below dangerous levels in fact while it acknowledged that its operations face some risks related to climate change policies and that the company favors governmental action to reduce the severity of climate change exxon said its plans call for all of its oil and gas reserves to be exploited for generating electricity and powering transportation among other uses through therefore the company said none of its oil and gas reserves are at risk of becoming â œstranded assets â instead these stores will be processed and ultimately burned releasing more planet warming gases such as carbon dioxide and methane â œthe risk of climate change is clear and the risk warrants action â said william colton exxon s vice president of corporate strategic planning in a press release however exxon said it is prioritizing the need to meet the worldâ s growing energy demands through its oil and gas products rather than addressing climate change during the next several decades â œall of exxonmobil s current hydrocarbon reserves will be needed along with substantial future industry investments to address global energy needs â colton said if all of exxonâ s oil and gas reserves were to be exploited that would release at least gigatons of carbon dioxide the main long lived greenhouse gas based on data the group fossil free indexes opens in a new window provided to mashable by comparison all the fossil fuels burned in the u s in released about gigatons of carbon dioxide according to the energy information agency opens in a new window and other estimates of the carbon dioxide emissions that would result from burning exxonâ s massive reserves are significantly higher including a figure of gigatons calculated by the environmental group org â œexxon basically says â we hear you about this climate change thing weâ re just not going to do anything about it â â said brett fleishman a org senior analyst in an email to mashable â œmaybe thatâ s because for the last decade exxon has remained at the top of the owners list of potential carbon dioxide held by fully public companies â in the reports and the press release exxon touted its investments in climate research efficiency improvements within the company and the companyâ s participation in â œconstructive dialogue on policy options â figure that illustrates projected climate futures under a low emissions rcp and high emissions rcp scenario along with observed changes in climate change risks credit u n ipcc working group ii until the company was one of the largest funders of organizations opens in a new window that deny the existence and severity of manmade global warming such as the chicago based heartland institute which is a free market think tank no need to plan for a low carbon scenario in its climate reports exxon ruled out the possibility that its leaders would seek to meet the ipccâ s low carbon development scenario which would limit global warming to degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels the global community including the united states agreed to that temperature target opens in a new window at a climate summit in copenhagen but since then emissions have continued to track far above the path that would be needed to meet that target exxon says trying to meet the degrees fahrenheit target would be too costly and it does not foresee a government mandated commitment to do so instead it foresees emissions growing along a mid range scenario which would yield warming of between about degrees fahrenheit and degrees fahrenheit compared to preindustrial levels by furthermore the company said its oil and gas reserves are too important for lifting millions of people worldwide out of poverty particularly in the developing world â œ we are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become â stranded â the companyâ s report said â œwe believe producing these assets is essential to meeting growing energy demand worldwide and in preventing consumers especially those in the least developed and most vulnerable economies from themselves becoming stranded in the global pursuit of higher living standards and greater economic opportunity â according to exxonâ s scenario for global development through the world will require about more energy in compared to the majority of which would still come from fossil fuels like oil and natural gas â œincreasing energy costs leads to a scarcity of affordable reliable and accessible energy and can additionally lead to social instability â the report said in its new report opens in a new window the ipcc warned that climate change itself will raise the risk of social instability and could help drive conflicts in already unstable parts of the world such as the middle east andrew logan who directs the oil and gas program at ceres a group that advocates changing market practices to incorporate long term risks like climate change said the reports are a positive step for exxon but discouraging at the same time â œultimately itâ s not up to exxon how the world deals with climate change â he told mashable â œwe strongly disagree with some of the companyâ s sense of the likelihood of global action â in other words in logan s view world leaders are likely to act more aggressively to curb climate change than exxon anticipates logan said itâ s

set to lose security support next week according to a review of federal solicitations and the agencies themselves the air force navy and marine corps as well as the veterans affairs labor and state departments are a few of the windows xp holdouts microsoft will stop updating the year old operating system on april with the company s software developers out of the picture hackers who find holes can drop day exploits or malicious software that penetrates systems running xp before anyone has time to fix them but some agencies need windows xp to run mission critical applications that are

information technology tools and services a legacy issue roughly of the pentagon s several million unclassified and classified windows machines are still running xp software according to military officials machines remaining on xp tend to require special engineering and testing to make sure that function and dependability are still correct after an operating system change richard hale deputy chief information officer for cybersecurity at the department of defense said during an interview those tend to also be systems that get deployed often in places that have high operations tempo like ships so it then takes us a while to deploy those defense has been upgrading primarily to other windows versions at a rate of up to computers a month it will probably take us several years to get the last windows xp machines transitioned hale said of approximately of the department s windows machines there may be some special cases that take longer the pentagon is negotiating prices with microsoft for extended windows xp support which will be lower than the commercial rate of per pc per year he said hale could not speak to the specific solicitations the services have issued but said he believes they pertain to systems stuck in the changeover as recently as a year ago we had hundreds of thousands of windows xp machines and so people have had to support them as they transitioned their networks to windows or windows he said they ve had to support them and they will need to support them until they are completely out of the inventory all military devices whether on xp or upgraded software are protected by layers of security systems hale said for instance we have perimeter defenses that look for malware and can block it as well as dod wide email scanning and intrusion detection systems he said cyber command to the rescue military cyber personnel will be paying attention to xp enabled threats cyber command is the top operator for the department and top defender for all of this stuff hale said every information security employee takes orders from the command while the military is not adding extra levels of defense as a direct consequence of microsoft s decision to terminate support for the old operating system our operations force will be attuned to windows xp attacks just in case those go up after april he said not all federal contracting documents mentioning xp required technology dependent on that platform alone indicating the purchasing agency could be planning to soon switch platforms for example in may veterans affairs asked for opens in a new window a mobile device security tool that must be compatible with os android windows mobile blackberry windows xp windows and windows va needs a windows xp system for the golden age games because agencies are

compatibility with and support on windows xp internet explorer and microsoft office are also required until april when microsoft s extended support for windows xp ends veterans affairs officials said that more than of the department s it inventory about windows computers is now on windows the systems still on xp are not compatible with windows and must be updated before the systems can be upgraded to the new operating system va spokeswoman genevieve billia said in an email those outliers seem to be creating disruptions and racking up expenses even if not creating risks some of the remaining xp systems will be removed from the network and other mitigation strategies will be put into place for those that remain billia said adding that the department might purchase extended support from microsoft additional security measures include an external firewall network monitoring intrusion protection software and usb drive controls among other things labor officials expect to move all computers to newer windows platforms by may as with all such transitions officials said the department is encountering some exceptions such as the two notebooks we continually monitor for security vulnerabilities and those efforts include xp based systems that are being discontinued as well as the few xp based functions that will remain in place until replacements are implemented a labor spokeswoman said in an email the state department during the past year apparently wanted a lot of technology that would work with windows xp but not necessarily depend on it to function properly,0

in a new window to determine the effects the shuttle program may have on the local environment supporters of the program claim it will lead to fewer drivers on the road and a full scale eir isn t

opponents of the program including harvey milk lgbt democratic club seiu the league of pissed off voters and housing rights committee executive director sara shortt says that an eir is necessary because of the california environmental quality act opens in a new window this act requires state and local agencies to identify the significant environmental impacts of their actions and to avoid or

tech bus protests throughout san francisco over the last few months tech shuttle supporters claim the buses help reduce pollution and traffic congestion by taking cars off the road fees from the program will cost companies roughly per year and more than for big companies like google that means the city should bring in a few million dollars per year through the program google defended its use

at public bus stops citing state vehicle code opens in a new window an activity which results in a fine for a san francisco citizen but only costs tech companies under the proposed shuttle program the

wheelchair claimed the tech shuttles keep the city buses from pulling all the way to the curb making it harder for disabled residents to use public transit ceqa doesn t mean stop the project drury

more than over debate isn t over ap,the associated press dropped a bomb on the journalism world on thursday with a tweet announcing a change in the organization s venerable stylebook cue the outrage from journalists and grammar aficionados the ap upended decades of journalistic tradition in less than characters and was immediately scorned for grammar heresy ap style tip new to the stylebook over as well as more than is acceptable to indicate greater numerical value opens in a new window â ap stylebook apstylebook march opens in a new window prior to the rule change the only acceptable use of the preposition over was in reference to physical proximity for example you could hold your hands over the piano keys or hover your mouse over that cute cat picture while you decide whether to like it on facebook more than was used to express relational quantity with numbers this is how you would tell the world that facebook has more than a billion users or you watched more than your friend did in a house of cards marathon the issue hit home here at mashable two of our editors are at loggerheads over the question of whether more than is actually an acceptable substitute for over takes sides below you ll also find our verdict below the case for overlap by alex hazlett more than over integrationist as an editor the ap stylebook may be more of a bible for me than the actual bible there are certainly more commandments but in this case we all just need to calm down this is a change we should be welcoming not deploring i get it the rules change seems to upend the order of things but the anger misses the point the rule never made sense in the first place it was an arbitrary style decision that had nothing to do with grammar defensible only by that rationale of last resort tradition more than over is not like the distinction between fewer and less than in that case there s a question of meaning less than refers to things that are uncountable or imprecise i have less free time than my dog or i make less than a million dollars saying i make fewer than a million dollars means that you re actually talking about a couple fewer dollar bills not just telling me that your salary is lower more than and over have never been this clearly delineated they ve been used interchangeably in certain contexts for decades in fact according to grammar girl that seo optimized high priestess of online language arts the only reason that the use of more than over was regulated was because new york evening post editor william cullen bryan preferred it opens in a new window in more than years later we re still bowing to that preference that s all it is a preference it s a way for us as journalists to demarcate our tribe and weed out those who aren t in it which is basically everyone who doesn t use an ap style guide there are clearly independent use cases where more than or over are each the only acceptable option we ll still be writing the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog over my dead body and joe exercises more than tom to switch those around would be clearly wrong and isn t what the ap was suggesting the change covers the cases in the middle where you want to refer to a greater quantity and where the words can often be substituted with no loss of meaning there s nary a difference in writing that lady gaga has over a million twitter followers instead over more than the meaning is clear and when you re trying to write tweets and short headlines five extra characters make a difference it s been a debate here at mashable whether to continue to abide by the old rule or adopt the new i m in the minority population one in lobbying for embracing the new rules internet journalists perhaps more than any other kind occupy the grey area on the cutting edge of language development the ap hasn t always caught up quickly to words like selfie yolo website and internet style is arbitrary and choosing which language etiquette to adhere to says more about us than it does about language as someone who helps write about the conversations we have online i want to be a part of that community and speak like our readers speak well write i m as much of a grammar curmudgeon as anyone it s literally my job and a specialized knowledge in which i take great pride but in this case i m firmly on the side of the democratic masses and i can t defend a rule that makes no sense the ap despite the nostalgic kerfuffle that s been frothing online is right on as usual the case against by megan hess more than over separatist thursday was an emotional day it began with a gchat from a coworker â œwhoa and a link to the poynter opens in a new window post relaying the news that the ap had removed its distinction between â œmore thanâ and over â is nothing sacred i fumed my college journalism courses were filled with professors drilling the difference into our heads style determines what makes something further or farther an implication or an inference without it the world turns into a lord of the flies esque dystopia but it wasnâ t just that j school loyalty that fueled my fire ap editors said â œoverwhelming usageâ of both terms prompted the change by that reasoning why not dump the entire ap stylebook in the garbage there are plenty of style rules that get overlooked i can t count the number of times i ve seen which instead of that but that doesn t mean we should completely disregard them the more than over distinction is a long heralded one that should not be given up lightly at the risk of sounding snobbish the distinction is one that distinguishes clean precise language and attention to detail and serves as a hallmark of a proper journalism training it denotes a common ground for people who care about the rules â œmore thanâ refers to numbers and quantities whereas â œoverâ refers to conceptual amounts and spatial relationships like over the finish line one can argue the distinction is more stylistic than grammatical and thatâ s fine publications online or print should be able to dictate their styles for themselves style still holds meaning above alex argues that the difference is an arbitrary one by the same token canâ t you argue that â œeffectâ versus â œaffectâ was just an arbitrary letter choice over time however that difference has accrued meaning to the masses we shouldn t disregard a century of meaning without a second thought the same holds true for â œmore thanâ versus â œover â merriam webster s online dictionary lists several uses of over one of which includes beyond some quantity limit or norm often by a specified amount or to a specified degree with the example phrase the show ran a minute over none of the example sentences use it in the stead of more than which is telling as journalists we should constantly evaluate and analyze our writing practices and whether they make sense the mere fact that weâ ve been doing something forever doesnâ t make it right the ap stylebook makes updates every year and i certainly agree with some of its recent changes opens in a new window but in this case the update was not made to keep up with cultural relevancy like the ap s addition of yolo or selfie as mentioned above itâ s a change i just canâ t get behind and i m not alone grammar nerds agree credit a brief interlude to show you that tweet credit and now the tirade continues credit our style guide at mashable deviates from the ap in some regards a recent addition includes cockblock as one word and this is one to add to the books plus fowlerâ s modern english

now all the news that fits on your mobile phone more or less,as someone old enough to remember life before the web i still associate the new york times with a big honking broadsheet something you hunker down with for a few hours on a sunday compared to easy reads like newsday or the new york post the times was daunting during the few times i subscribed to daily delivery i would feel a creeping sense of guilt as the old copies amassed in my recycling bin mostly unread since the times equals high quality in depth content in my mind there s a bit of cognitive dissonance regarding its latest move into mobile media the phone isn t designed for longreads in this medium snackable content is the rule adapting the gray lady to this emerging media landscape has been tricky yet she has no choice in february there were about million visitors to nytimes com opens in a new window according to comscore denise warren executive vice president of digital products and services says that something like to of readers come from mobile mostly phones on an average day but on big news days the number approaches it s not clear how much traffic comes from flipboard which has distributed times content since the times is attempting to meet this trend head on with nyt now opens in a new window a new app it released wednesday on ios sorry no android version yet the premise the best of the times and some curated content from other sources including rival the wall street journal presented in snackable bites if you re in the market for a minute read to bring you up to speed on the news of the day this may be just what you re looking for however if you were imagining an app that catered the news to your particular interests you may find nyt now wanting similarly if you re already a times subscriber this isn t necessarily for you warren says the target for this app are people who want more than the allocated free articles per month limit on digital but aren t ready to spend every four weeks for full digital access at for every days nyt now is meant to woo these casual readers if you re already a subscriber nyt now is free meanwhile if you want to go deeper the times on wednesday also introduced times premier which gives you additional content like behind the scenes interviews with reporters premier crosswords and ebooks for an extra every four weeks one of this month s titles the life and times of philip seymour hoffman warren says the times has done its research and knows that those a month readers are out there but i m not convinced there are so many news reader apps on the market already with free content including flipboard facebook s paper and google play newsstand that it s hard to believe that there s a user whose news needs aren t being met and if you like times content that much why not pay or just keep switching browsers warren says that surprisingly few people exercise this option to get around the articles per month limit the experience like other news apps designed for mobile phones nyt now doesn t look anything like a newspaper there s no front page instead there s a not quite endless scroll atop the scroll is the latest big news story at am on wednesday that was supreme court rejects cap on donors total gifts in u s races opens in a new window if wanted the quick version there were two paragraphs for a deeper dive you could tap on the headline to see the full story credit other big stories wednesday morning included the mideast peace talks a piece on people who bought insurance in the last few months but weren t included in the affordable care act s official tally and another article about police grappling with a rising number of mentally ill citizens in total there were stories in the scroll including two opinion pieces in addition there were two videos and one ad from cartier the ads are something new for the times paid posts a k a native advertising a times rep says the ad should appear once in the news stream at any given time that cartier ad will also run after every stories in our picks a second scroll that curates content from elsewhere on wednesday i saw articles from the detroit news philadelphia magazine and youtube a viral video featuring samuel l jackson s slam poem about boy meets world of the two feeds our picks featured much more varied content and was updated more often it s your dessert after wading through the more sober news feed there are some other neat features if you see a story that interests you but don t have time to read it you can save it to read later clifford levy the editor of nyt now says there will also be several special updates throughout the day at am you can see the morning update then there s a lunchtime read from noon to and then a nighttime read from pm to midnight levy says those times will adjust to your phone s clock so if you fly to los angeles for instance the morning update will come at am pst however that just applies to u s travel if you re in say china you re not going to see the lunchtime read at noon local time when asked why a consumer would use nyt now vs any of the other free apps out there levy said the human touch was the key this is an app that s curated by humans he says it s not done by an algorithm that s shoveling you stuff those humans about in all will be working around the clock to find appropriate content for the app though there s a smaller staff at night someone will always be on duty levy says the other selling point is times content levy says at the heart of this app is great new york times journalism he says utility there s no doubt that the new york times remains one of the most trusted news brands in the world however when it comes to stories like the supreme court ruling referenced above you don t necessarily need the times version to get the gist digital media has had a flattening effect on brands like the times at this point it s safe to say most readers care more about the story they re reading than the source luckily the times has a lot of great content at its disposal for me though there s not much utility to nyt now unless i can customize the news feed i have an insatiable appetite for tech and business news for instance and if i knew nyt now would reliably deliver such info to my phone then i d be an enthusiastic supporter however in my experience if there s huge breaking news outside of business and tech it usually finds me that said i ll be watching nyt now levy said that in tests consumers tended to just read news on their mobile phones in the mornings in the afternoon they d drift off to games and social media however the times found that nyt now users tended to habitually tune into the curated feed late in the day,1

to almost having it all opens in a new window you can follow her on instagram ramshackleglam opens in a new window for several days last week ramshackleglam com opens in a new window â the domain name that i have owned and operated since march of â did not belong to me but rather to a man who goes by the name â œbahbouhâ on an auction website called flippa com opens in a new window and who was attempting to sell off the site to the highest bidder with a â œbuy it nowâ price of he promised the winner my traffic my files and my data and suggested that i was available â œfor hireâ to continue writing posts alternatively he was willing to provide the winner with â œhigh quality articlesâ and â œseo adviceâ to maintain the siteâ s traffic post sale i learned that my site was stolen on a saturday three days later i had it back but only after the involvement of fifty or so employees of six different companies middle of the night conferences with lawyers fbi intervention and what amounted to a sting operation that probably should have starred sandra bullock instead ofâ wellâ me of course iâ ve heard of identity theft and of cyber hacking but honestly my attitude towards these things was very much â œit could never happen to me â and even if it didâ i didnâ t exactly understand why it was such a huge deal couldnâ t you just explain to people what had happened prove who you were and sort it all out we live in such a highly documented world it seemed completely impossible to me that someone could actually get away with pretending to be someone else with any real consequences beyond a few phone calls and some irritation itâ s much much worse â more threatening more upsetting and more difficult if not impossible to fix â than iâ d ever imagined i found out about the hacking from my father his friend anthony who is his partner at pro italia online opens in a new window and who runs a web development and consulting company called thoughtbox opens in a new window had been surfing around on flippa and had â in an impossibly lucky coincidence â noticed that my site was up for auction with what appeared to be a highly suspicious listing suddenly i remembered the email i had gotten the day before â an email that i had disregarded as spam â from someone â œinterested in the purchaseâ of my â œweblogâ i remembered the notification from youtube that someone had accessed my account from a different location â a notification i had ignored assuming that i had logged in on a mobile device or that my husband had accidentally logged into my account instead of his own but even after i saw the listing i didnâ t panic this seemed like something that could be fixed with a couple of emails except the auction site was located in australia and didnâ t appear to have a phone number and when i sent an email with a scanned id and proof of ownership what i got back was a form letter and when i called hostmonster the site i pay to operate my website i discovered that i was no longer the owner of my site someone had used their email confirmation system to authorize the transfer of my domain name into a private account at godaddy another web registrar service of whom iâ m also a client credit why is this a big deal if you have a business that depends on a url you understand why this was such upsetting news with control over my websiteâ s domain name a hacker would be able to take the site down or redirect it elsewhere further it was later verified that the hacker had control over all of the siteâ s content as well he could have just rerouted everything iâ ve ever written to any location he wanted ramshackle glam may be â œjustâ a lifestyle blog about things like parenting and fashion and decorâ but itâ s also a site that iâ ve spent five years of my life building and the idea of it falling into the hands of someone with malicious intent was heartbreaking i could switch to a new url and export a copy of my content which i do back up but that would result in the loss of a substantial amount of traffic the website is my primary source of income and with a house opens in a new window a child opens in a new window another child opens in a new window on the way a book opens in a new window coming out this week and a husband in business school opens in a new window this was not a joke the loss of my url had the potential to be devastating for my business and for my family in a very real way so what did i do the events of the next few days were complicated so rather than go through them chronologically iâ m going to explain how each path i took ended up panning out iâ m going into detail so that i can be as much help as possible to anyone who goes through this themselves i tried to resolve the situation directly with godaddy and hostmonster this did not work from sunday through tuesday i spent most of the day and much of the night on the phone with godaddy hostmonster or both at the same time and nearly every person i spoke with gave me the same response â œsorry canâ t help you â hostmonster maintained that because they no longer controlled the domain name there was nothing they could do godaddy maintained that because the account was private and the person had obtained ownership of the domain through a transfer from hostmonster there was nothing they could do what finally made a difference i cited icannâ s policy on domain name dispute resolution opens in a new window this got my case upgraded but it did not result in action hereâ s why the legal department at hostmonster informed me that in order for them to initiate a transfer dispute that would result in godaddy releasing the domain back to me their â œinternal investigationâ would have to turn up evidence that they had done something wrong in releasing the site in other words they would have to admit that they had screwed upâ which would in turn open them up to a lawsuit needless to say i never heard from the legal department again despite the fact that everyone seemed clear on the fact that i owned my website and that it had been transferred without my authorization nothing was going to be done unless i initiated a time consuming and costly lawsuit that in any case would not result in action quick enough to save my domain name from being sold so that avenue came to an end if your domain is transferred without your authorization tell the support staff answering the registrar hotline that you have a teac situation and that you need to speak with a supervisor immediately then cite icann policy to initiate an investigation i called the fbi this was a major step in the right direction the morning after i found out about the unauthorized transfer i also called the fbi i felt silly and dramatic making the phone call but the reality is that this is an international cyber crime issue and thatâ s fbi territory and this is my business itâ s how i support my family and it may be a â œsmall matterâ in the grand scheme of things but it is not a small matter to me and let me tell you of all the surprises iâ ve had over the past week or so most surprising of all has been the fbi they responded immediately with follow up phone calls and emails an in person interview with two special agents at my own home within hours and a follow up visit from two agents yesterday beyond that each and every agent i have interacted with over the past week has been without fail compassionate thoughtful invested respectful and committed to actionâ in addition to treating me not like a case number but like a human what i expected was to leave a message with a general mailbox and at some point receive a form letter i certainly did not expect to see an active investigation opened immediately iâ m not going to write more about the investigation because itâ s still ongoing although i did ask for and receive permission to write about this but i think itâ s important to say how absolutely blown away i have been by the fbiâ s response i tried to regain control by dealing directly with the â œsellerâ this worked but not without considerable drama while all of the above was going on i was also working to regain control over the site directly from the individual who was trying to sell it i didnâ t want to contact the â œsellerâ directly because i felt that if he thought the â œrealâ owner of the site was aware of the sale he would try to extort more money so i asked anthony â the person who had found the original listing and who had an active account with a positive history on flippa â to dm â œbahbouhâ to see if he was interested in a â œprivate saleâ after some back and forth we reached an agreement and it was decided that a third party money transfer website escrow com opens in a new window would be used to make the sale the money would only be released to the seller upon confirmation that the domain name had been transferred this appeared to be going smoothly until tuesday night when the seller suddenly demanded that the funds be released immediately prior to receipt of the website when we pushed back he announced that he was selling it to someone else â œsorry bye â so here was my thought process if we did not release the money to the seller we were guaranteed to not get the website if we did release the money to him there was a possibility that he would take the money and run and also a possibility that he would deliver the site as promised it wasnâ t a gamble i wanted to takeâ but i didnâ t see any option and so i authorized the wire transfer i spent twenty minutes sitting in front of the dummy godaddy account i had created to receive the domain name from the seller waiting to see whether i was out thousands of dollars and a domain name or just thousands of dollars and then it came through i immediately transferred the domain into a different account and placed it and all of my other domain names on what amounted to lockdown and then i called the wire transfer company and placed a stop on the payment the end result ramshackleglam com is back in my possession thanks to a number of people who dedicated hours in some cases days out of their lives to doing whatever they could to help me my other accounts â bank accounts et cetera â have been secured i donâ t have my money back yet but the man who stole my site from me doesnâ t have it either and wonâ t be getting it ever and thatâ s an ending iâ m pretty damn thrilled with so why am i still angry of course iâ m angry with the person or people who stole the site but thatâ s out of my hands the reason iâ m writing this post is to let people know that this really can happen â to anyone â and to offer suggestions for how to minimize the chances that it will happen to you below but beyond that iâ m writing this post because this incident made me very very angry at godaddy and hostmonster and i want you to know why no one at either company questioned my statement supported by written proof that the website belonged to me no one doubted that it had been transferred without my authority and yet i had to spend days â days during which the hacker could have done virtually anything he wanted â trying to reach one single person who was able to do anything because the support staff and supervisors i spoke with who had to have numbered fifty or more were completely uninformed as to how to handle this situation beyond saying â œjeez that sucks canâ t help you â and once i reached people who could help me â who could literally make a single phone call or push a single button and return my property to me or simply freeze it so that it could not be sold or destroyed â they would not they hid behind their legal departments and refused to do anything knowing full well that their inaction would force me to either interact with and pay off a criminal or lose an essential component of my business and hackers know that these companies will do this they rely on it there is a serious problem when a criminal enterprise not only exists â œdespiteâ a companyâ s policies but actually thrives as a direct result of that companyâ s prioritization of their own interests over the security of the clients they allegedly â œprotectâ do i understand why companies like hostmonster and godaddy are focused on protecting themselves against lawsuits of course i do but the fact is that they not only do not â œhelpâ their customers but actively contribute to creating situations that threaten small businesses and the families that they support and these companies know that when they stonewall clients whose property has obviously been stolen that these clients will have no other recourse than to pay off criminals or watch their businesses â sometimes their very lives collapse they know that by standing in the way of immediate action they create the very environment that these criminals depend upon to perpetuate their business model and they do nothing this has to change my opinion for what it s worth support personnel at hosting companies should be made intimately familiar with icann regulations involving domain disputes and should be able to initiate a plan of action the first time a client makes them aware of a situation not after hours and hours of repeated calls further the establishment of a teac should result in an immediate freeze on the account in dispute until the situation has been resolved this should not require an admission of culpability on the part of any parties simply an acknowledgement that a dispute exists and an awareness that while the dispute exists the domain must be held safe from sale or transfer what you can do to reduce the chances that this will happen to you have a really really good password and change it often your password should not contain â œrealâ words and definitely not more than one real word in immediate proximity like â œwhitecatâ or â œangrybirdâ and should contain capital letters numbers and symbols the best passwords of all look like total nonsense if possible use a separate computer an old one or a cheap one purchased for this purpose for things like banking if your family computer is the same one that you use for bank transactions you risk having your kids click on a bad link that results in a hacking turn off your computer and personal devices when theyâ re not in use have antivirus software on your computer but remember that virus scans only catch of viruses so unfortunately a â œcleanâ check doesnâ t necessarily mean that youâ re safe purchase cyberrisk insurance opens in a new window learn more about it here it basically protects businesses from cyber attacks and data breaches but if it does happen to you here s what to do begin taking careful notes and screenshots immediately donâ t delete any emails or other information it could all be important later on immediately change all of your passwords including â but not limited to â domain registrar website hosting website login information email bank accounts wireless home electronics and apple id according to the rules stated below i changed mine every few hours while this situation was still up in the air and am continuing to change them every few days for the time being contact the registrar s citing the icann policy below and see if together you can arrive at a speedy resolution donâ t be surprised if you find yourself running into dead ends make sure to inquire about â œfiltersâ and â œrulesâ that may have been placed on your email basically any kind of device that the hackers may have placed to forward emails et cetera contact appropriate law enforcement i contacted the fbi because it appeared to be an international issue and was at the very least an interstate issue because escrow com is located in california and iâ m in new york note every situation is different and i canâ t wholeheartedly recommend the steps that i took that ultimately resulted in me regaining control over my domain name largely because they involved interacting with criminals obviously that isnâ t ideal and can have unpredictable consequences although my husband says that he would like it to be known that he thinks iâ m a huge badass while this is ordinarily very far from the truth in this specific instanceâ iâ ll take it,1

drivers in dash web browsing habits revealed,the race is on to snag the attention of drivers via new internet enabled dashboard touchscreens but metrics on exactly how popular this new browsing experience might be have largely been a mystery until now quantcast has released numbers from a study conducted over a day period designed to give us some insight into the in dash usage habits of tesla owners the study which gleaned stats from million digital destinations over a day period between feb and march offers a rough sketch of what the average tesla owner s in dash usage looks like this data is based on websites using quantcast measure for their audience measurement a quantcast spokesperson told mashable the tesla browser has an identifier called a user agent similar to a chrome or firefox browser we looked at all visits to measured websites from the tesla browser predictably usage of the inch in dash touchscreen peaks during typical commuting times in this case a m to a m and to p m respectively overall the study found that news sites comprised the largest usage of tesla s in dash screen making up of the websites visited after news services restaurants finding purchasing entertainment auto related services real estate travel shopping accounted for of the usage followed by entertainment and lifestyle within the news vertical the study opens in a new window found that or roughly half of the news consumption views were devoted to local news sites a possible shot in the arm to beleaguered local news ventures like patch quantcast s study also found that of the news consumed was financial in nature interestingly the study also found that the conservative news aggregation site the drudgereport opens in a new window accounted for of overall web browsing traffic this can be taken in a couple of ways depending on how you parse the data either it means that tesla owners generally affluent at this point lean conservative or it could just be attributed to the quick loading bare bones design of the drudgereport website credit quantcast another interesting data point from the study reveals how usage of the tesla tracks across the u s according to quantcast s data california is the leading source of browser views at followed by georgia at texas at and new york and illinois at each what s most interesting about quantcast s data is that it exists at all there are numerous laws on the books in various u s states prohibiting the use of television screens in cars while driving so yes a touchscreen tablet style dashboard isn t a television but it could be reasonably argued that it might be just as distracting during web browsing sessions in california the state with the most web browsing activity according to the study the law states opens in a new window it is unlawful to drive a motor vehicle equipped with a television receiver a video monitor or a television or video screen or any other similar means of usually displaying a television broadcast if the receiver is located in the vehicle at any point forward of the back of the driverâ s seat however the law makes exceptions for windshield and dashboard mounted gps devices and systems designed to prevent the driver from viewing them but neither of those exceptions describes the kind of in dash touchscreen used in the tesla in the next most popular web content viewing state in the study georgia no such restriction exists but in all the other states listed in the study including texas illinois washington ohio new york washington d c the laws regarding screens in cars are largely similar opens in a new window to those in california no distracting screens allowed while driving although the tesla s dashboard screen does not have the ability to display web video on tesla s own user forums opens in a new window some owners of the vehicle openly admit that the vehicle s in dash screen can indeed be distracting in response to the growing use of media rich mobile devices the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa released voluntary guidelines last year opens in a new window the agency s guidelines recommend that vehicles be stopped and in park during situations involving the display of certain types of text including text messages web pages social media content of course the dashboard computer industry is still so young that we re likely to see even more guidelines crop up in the coming years for now we can only hope that the stats from quantcast s study represent instances in which the vehicles were in park and while quantcast s study is

vs mexico what you need to know for wednesday s world cup tuneup,the united state men s national team usmnt takes on mexico on wednesday night from phoenix ariz its final international match before opening world cup training camp next month whether you re a longtime usmnt supporter or a casual soccer fan just getting world cup fever here s what you need to know the world cup s not until june what is this seattle sounders midfielder clint dempsey right keeps his game face on as he shakes hands with his fellow u s national team member and toronto fc midfielder michael bradley left before an mls soccer match in seattle on march credit ted s warren if you re new to the game of soccer a friendly is a match that doesn t count on either team s record teams play them all the time to try out prospective players or just get in some practice this is the usmnt s final friendly before world cup training camp begins but the american team will play three more just before leaving for brazil in june those matches should feature essentially the final usmnt roster as manager jurgen klinsmann has until june to submit his final man list of players this match meanwhile features a roster made up almost entirely of american players who play professionally in the united states or mexico many others play for european clubs for some it will be a key chance to impress klinsmann one more time and hopefully earn an invite to training camp for others guaranteed a world cup spot it s an important opportunity to build chemistry with teammates so this game may not count but it definitely matters espn s broadcast starts at p m et what to watch for usa s eddie johnson right and clint dempsey left celebrate after johnson scored a goal against panama during world cup qualifier soccer match on june in seattle credit ted s warren we ll be treated to a preview of three of the usmnt s more important players michael bradley clint dempsey and landon donovan watch how they read one another and see if they can do some damage together on the attack and in the midfield if the usmnt is to make some noise in brazil this summer it will need all three mls stalwarts to create scoring chances and control the ball against top notch competition beyond those three stars wednesday is also an excellent chance to get a look at some lesser american lights who could nonetheless contribute significantly in brazil among the names to keep an eye on midfielder graham zusi and defender matt besler of sporting kansas city in mls midfielder maurice edu of the philadelphia union los angeles galaxy defender omar gonzalez and dc united striker eddie johnson it s likely that half the usmnt roster will ultimately be made up of mls players you can read more about the other candidates here meanwhile here s the usmnt s official highlight video if you re looking to get pumped up what s the deal with this julian green kid the short answer no one really knows but we should know more after wednesday the longer answer if you re just catching up green is an year old german american forward who was born in tampa but lived almost his entire life in germany he plays for bayern munich the world s top club team but had the option of playing internationally for either the united states or germany which has one of the best national teams in the world in march green committed opens in a new window his international future the united states this is seen as a potentially huge deal for american soccer as many feel a player with his combination of youth and potential has never before chosen to suit up for the united states over another country bayern munich s julian green right challenges an opponent for the ball during a friendly match in doha qatar on jan credit osama faisal but is getting green a move that could simply pay longterm dividends or might he actually help this summer no one knows for sure and some skeptics fear adding him to the final man world cup roster over a player who s been grinding away for this opportunity for years could disrupt the team s chemistry then again if green can really add something it d be stupid to leave him home whatever the future holds green is all but assured to play against mexico on wednesday giving many usmnt fans their first real look at him in action the mexican club that wouldn t damarcus beasley and michael orozco are both americans who play for puebla f c in mexico s liga mx they re both players who klinsmann called up for wednesday s friendly and they re both players puebla would not release for the match this didn t make klinsmann happy and he took to twitter among other places to vent very disappointed that pueblafc opens in a new window did not release damarcus beasley michael orozco not in the spirit of this great rivalry â jã¼rgen klinsmann j klinsmann march opens in a new window so what the hell is going on here puebla is not legally obligated to release beasley and orozco since wednesday s match doesn t fall on one of the official international match dates laid out by fifa world soccer s governing body klinsmann purposely did not call up other american players who play for clubs that have important matches of their own this week puebla however doesn t play again until saturday puebla in fact is doing so poorly this season that it s in danger of being demoted to a lesser mexican division trying to avoid that relegation is its best rationalization for keeping the two americans home more than likely however there s a bit of partisan gamesmanship at play here from the mexican club just because this thing is called a friendly doesn t mean it s that friendly after all a first look at the usmnt s new look the usmnt unveiled its new away kits that means uniforms for you soccer on tuesday and will wear them for the first time on wednesday against mexico they ll wear them in brazil too along with these previously unveiled home numbers opens in a new window here s what the brand new away kits look like as modeled by clint dempsey new ussoccer opens in a new window away kit usmnt opens in a new window will wear it in brazil this summer for worldcup opens in a new window vs mex tmrw in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â sam laird samcmlaird april opens in a new window many online were quick to dismiss the jerseys as looking vaguely russian or resembling a classic brand of popsicle opens in a new window we don t think they look so bad at all but are curious to see them on the field wednesday now back to that world cup we mentioned usa s michael bradley stands during player introductions before a world cup qualifier soccer match against panama on june in seattle credit ted s warren this match is important in many ways but don t take any positive or negatives from it too seriously coming from their regular professional clubs this batch of usmnt players won t have practiced together much before kickoff and that will likely show a bit similarly there are many big names jozy altidore and tim howard for example not playing so klinsmann can get a better look at others based closer to home and the mexican squad won t be at full strength either all that being said it s definitely worth keeping an eye on what s ahead for both countries the united states finished first in the two countries shared regional qualifying group while mexico surprisingly needed a playoff win over new zealand to reach the world cup but the united states was unfortunate to get a tougher draw when pool play foursomes were decided landing alongside germany portugal and ghana in group g mexico meanwhile landed in a group a with host country brazil croatia and cameroon the usmnt s group g is already being called this year s group of death but mexico s draw is no cakewalk either suffice to say both sides could use all the practice they can get before the world cup starts june practice that begins wednesday night against one another,0

s war of rhetoric lands on new york times op ed page,as protests continue in venezuela the war of words between the government and its opposition rages on now in the new york times opinion pages revealing the depth of the rift between the two sides the paper on tuesday published an op ed by venezuela s president nicolas maduro calling for peace and dialogue opens in a new window a week earlier one of venezuela s main opposition leaders leopoldo lopez wrote his own editorial opens in a new window from prison also published in the times denouncing the country as a failing state see also colombian press sends tons of newsprint to venezuelan newspapers the dueling op eds of course each stick to a narrative that ignores the complaints of their opponent maduro focuses on a narrative of class warfare that calls for peaceful dialogue without mentioning that his government has jailed some of the opposition lopez criticizes the current government without acknowledging any of its merits both call for dialogue but appear to put forth incompatible rhetoric maduro posits that the state of venezuela is not as bad as it appears poverty has been greatly reduced there s free healthcare and education and a democracy of which venezuelans are proud he reminds readers that in former u s president jimmy carter proclaimed opens in a new window the nation s electoral system the best in the world lopez on the other hand writes that venezuela is plagued by an oppressive political climate a crippled economy and the governmentâ s criminalization of dissent he adds i am struck by how much venezuelans have suffered the president has his own accusations to levy at the opposition the protesters have a single goal the unconstitutional ouster of the democratically elected government writes maduro he accuses opposition leaders of fomenting chaos in the streets and supporting a takeover like the coup aimed at former president hugo chavez in lopez however writes that the opposition s demands are not so sinister they consist of the resignation of those responsible for repression abuse and torture freedom for political prisoners and dissenters and investigation into fraud committed through our commission for currency exchange which lopez says is at the root of the crippling inflation rate and though lopez issues a call to action that says venezuelans must continue to speak act and protest he stresses restraint a change in leadership can be accomplished entirely within a constitutional and legal framework venezuela s president nicolas maduro speaks at a meeting with a south american delegation of foreign ministers at the miraflores presidential palace in caracas venezuela on march credit fernando llano maduro for his part stops short of calling protesters fascists as he has in the past but he writes that they are part of the wealthier segments of society painting the conflict as a class war in which the u s government is on the wrong side it is on the side of the who wish to drag our country back to when the were shut out of political life and only the few â including american companies â benefited from venezuelaâ s oil he writes but the reality in venezuela seems more complicated than a rich versus poor narrative can explain lower income citizens have not joined the protests in large numbers the new york times opens in a new window has reported but that doesn t necessarily mean there is monolithic agreement among the poor and some from poor neighborhoods across the country have indeed taken to the streets as the guardian reports opens in a new window maduro finally calls for dialogue and diplomacy stressing that his government has reached out to the opposition by starting mediated talks with it but he doesn t mention the fact that his government has also used a heavy hand against at least some of the opposition including sending elected leaders to jail lopez was imprisoned and charged with arson and conspiracy though he was previously also accused of murder and terrorism for allegedly inciting the feb protests in caracas which ended with three people dead allegedly shot by uniformed officers from the bolivarian national intelligence service sebin to this day no evidence of any kind has been presented lopez writes venezuelan congresswoman maria corina machado left and opposition leader leopoldo lopez center are surrounded by anti government demonstrators before lopez surrenders to national guards in caracas venezuela on feb credit uan manuel hernandez another opposition leader maria corina machado has been stripped of her seat in congress and the government intends to jail her for treason two opposition mayors have also been arrested and sentenced to prison maduro and lopez also differed in their assessment of the violence that has resulted from the protests lopez initially wrote that the over fatalities were protesters a correction at the bottom of his op ed notes while the reality is that some police have been killed maduro for his part said protesters were responsible for causing about half of the fatalities george cicariello maher a political science assistant professor at drexel university and author of we created chã vez a peopleâ s history of the venezuelan revolution opens in a new window notes that the opposition has effectively used twitter to spread its message and narrative the hashtag sosvenezuela which has been trending at times during the past few weeks was also widely used in the first few days of the protests to share updates and images maduro s op ed therefore is an attempt at countering the existing narrative on venezuela and an attempt to shift public opinion internationally cicariello maher says in its own editorial on march before either maduro s or lopez s op eds were published the new york times editorial board opens in a new window suggested the two sides of the venezuelan crisis are playing a blame game this is a bitterly divided population in urgent need of mediated dialogue the times editorial board wrote with their leaders each pointing fingers squarely at the other it s not looking as if common ground will be found any time soon,0

viral videos the secret marketing weapon,doveâ s â œreal beauty sketches â kmartâ s â œship your pants â volvoâ s â œthe epic split feat van damme â itâ s clear that viral videos arenâ t just low quality fan made shots or off the cuff scenes from everyday life brands are now fully immersed in the viral video world ads continue to move from print and broadcast to digital and mobile and we are seeing them everywhere see also best practices for creating viral branded videos brands are now looking to connect with their audiences in a way that not only provides enjoyment to the viewer but also aligns with the qualities that companies want to embody what were once brick and mortar businesses are now becoming adroit visual storytellers many industry experts consider video to be marketing s new frontier be it through youtube or short stories on instagram vine and snapchat but creating a successful video is more of an art than a science branded videos spread like wildfire for the same reason non branded videos go viral they re compelling and shareable and making something that a consumer wants to share particularly for entertainment value is critical for success videos should prompt people to engage with a brand in a genuine fashion ultimately people share viral videos branded or not because they ve stumbled across something they think is worth spreading the word about regardless of a brand s ulterior motives therein lies the magic the more views and shares your video receives the more people you reach and the more an audience becomes aware of your brand and potentially what you stand for why are they effective a youtube video lets brands be more experimental and risky than a tv print or sidebar ad just check out virgin americaâ s daring ad from last year which is actually a flight safety video brands can use music and clever techniques to produce something more provocative more heartbreaking more electrifying name an emotion and video can evoke it if a picture s worth a thousand words then a video s worth thousands more branded videos can also be as long as necessary as opposed to a standard or second tv spot still some particularly catchy or touching opens in a new window tv ads go viral of their own accord once posted online see also the art of the branded video the skyâ s the limit in terms of how a brand makes a video memorable many bank on humor and others heart most videos align themselves with positive messages feminism power quality organic goodness rather than contesting negative ones some do both in september chipotle released a short film entitled â œthe scarecrow â its emotionally appealing combination of sad stop motion critters and a dynamic message that tugged at our heartstrings feels like a kid friendly pixar short the brand recruited fiona apple to sing a haunting rendition of â œpure imagination â knowingly tapping into her personal fanbase above all the video re aligns the company with a message chipotle has long been promoting â œfood with integrity â at more than three minutes â œthe scarecrowâ is longer than most viral videos but the poignant mini film is so powerful that itâ s not only shareable but also almost almost makes us forget about the brand s fake twitter hacking fiasco just a few months prior if chipotle released the video to counter its pr debacle it worked people aren t fooled they know chipotle is a money making corporation but they ve become fans of the brand because it stands for something greater than simply chicken burritos see also things any video needs to go viral brand visibility and timing some of the most outstanding content that brands are publishing trends toward lightly rather than overtly branded videos instead of focusing on self promotion brands ensure their videos have appeal the promotion and brand affinity comes later consider that most ads only reveal their brand affiliation at the end rather than pulsing the brand throughout sometimes viewers might not even realize they re watching a branded video until the final frame and if viewers make it to the end like what they see and upon seeing the brand s name are pleasantly surprised thatâ s a win when it comes to launch style there s a spectrum of options some videos such as red bullâ s supersonic freefall by felix baumgartner are hyped up through social media far in advance in this particular case this method makes sense as the brand was looking to break a world record and garner support and attention at the other end of the spectrum some brands release a video online without disclosing who or what produced it or the brandâ s intent a recent example is clothing company wren s opens in a new window video â œfirst kiss â which many viewers initially believed to be a short film there s also the approach of the follow up making of video as kuka robotics opens in a new window experimented with after releasing â œthe duel timo boll vs kuka robot perhaps the most popular examples of brand withholding are the prank videos from jimmy kimmel such as the recent â œworst twerk fail everâ and â œepic sochifail wolf in my hall â these types of buzzworthy videos get everyone talking and promote kimmel s personal brand and he mostly gets away with it due to the nature of his profession though there has been some backlash this approach can be risky for branded content if a brand doesnâ t immediately disclose that itâ s behind a viral video people may feel as if the company was disingenuous or even feel resentful for being tricked into thinking something was real when it was actually staged knowing the risks itâ s up to the brand to predict how viewers will respond all in all there are a number of strategies brands can employ when it comes to approaching branded viral videos yes shelling out to make a video can be time consuming and quite costly but thatâ s not always the case helloflo s opens in a new window camp gyno video was created for just short and long term implications thereâ s always the chance that even after all those dollars and hours spent on production a video will flop or maybe it ll go viral but those hits won t translate to financial success or retail performance but visual storytelling can help your organization stay relevant in ways that cannot be measured and the trend doesn t seem to be going anywhere soon better

that s new in the windows update,windows critics this is it the windows update was made to fix everything you think is wrong with microsoft s touch friendly version of windows that probably won t stop the complaints but with this update the new touch and tile centric windows finally feels right on traditional mouse and keyboard setups mainly laptops individually the new features are fairly minor but overall they represent a power shift for those machines a reassertion of the desktop in windows and later the desktop felt more or less like just another app among the array of live tiles on the start screen even if you spent the majority of your time with desktop apps it seemed that windows was trying to throw you back to the modern environment aka metro every chance it got opening a simple photo for instance launched the modern photos not a desktop app now things are different post windows update the desktop is felt throughout the experience on a laptop or traditional pc touch first devices such as the surface and surface pro get some of the updates but the desktop stays in the background the effect is often subtle but sometimes it s a godsend we recognize that for a certain group of people namely people who use a mouse and keyboard we could have done a better job of building a bridge from where those people are currently to what we built inside of windows christopher flores microsoft s director of windows client communications told mashable is a collection of minor updates that we ve done to complete the overall experience anyone with windows will get the update on april there s no manual download required it ll happen automatically here s an overview of the most important changes boot to desktop default windows introduced the option to boot to desktop but you had to hunt it down in a settings menu to engage it now your pc will boot to the desktop automatically you can always change it back of course modern apps in the taskbar credit microsoft the taskbar the little ribbon that runs along the bottom of the screen in the desktop somehow got a bad rap in the initial rollout of windows modern apps didn t show up there and even the start button didn t want to be a part of it in windows the start button made a dramatic return to the taskbar and in the update the apps follow you can now pin modern apps to the taskbar switching between them without ever going to start or using the left side app drawer the taskbar will even appear in any modern app if you push down on the bottom of the screen to get users started pinning modern apps the update pins the windows store to the taskbar by default when you pin the store by default to one of the most uis in windows people start clicking on it says microsoft s chaitanya sareen who led the visual design team for windows and there s a good chunk of people who aren t familiar with apps putting that front and center has increased engagement title bars as a kind of companion to the taskbar a title bar drops down from the top of the screen when you launch a modern app then goes away after a few seconds these are actually not new they re actually borrowed from the windows desktop apps full screen modes probably most used with internet explorer moving the mouse pointer to the top of the screen brings the header back anytime and it includes icons for closing and minimizing this is the windows dna sareen says people see the familiar controls minimize close and we were very pleasantly surprised that in our usability study we had success of people getting out of a modern app desktop apps are default one of the more frustrating things about windows has been it favoring of the modern ui at inappropriate times if you say double clicked on a video file it would instantly launch the modern version of windows media player thrusting you into the full screen experience even though you probably didn t want or expect that to happen the update does the more sensible thing and by default will launch the desktop versions of those apps when you click it s a subtle change that really makes a huge difference for ease of use of course you can alter the defaults if you wish the feedback we got is i like apps but i like to go there on my own terms says sareen search and shutdown icons credit microsoft even though you can search just by typing from the start screen that s not immediately obvious to new users so the update adds a search icon to the top right of the start screen to bestow a visual clue likewise there s an icon for shutting down the machine which was previously a swipe away a little redundancy never hurt anybody sareen explains there are some people who totally got on that train and can just type and they trust the machine others need that cue so we just added that cue back little things the update includes a few other tweaks when you search windows store apps will show up in the results which gives developers another way users may discover their apps live tiles now have proper right click menus for mouse setups the all apps list has better markers for new apps as well as notifications the os disk image is smaller for some machines freeing up a little more device storage and microsoft added back some functionality in internet explorer so certain enterprise customers will finally have a web browser with their customized apps the final fix unlike some of the upgrades in windows the changes in the windows update are almost universally subtle and minor so why did microsoft take so long to implement them the company isn t saying officially but from the pattern it s easy to discern an admission that microsoft perhaps went too far in designing a touch friendly version of windows while it was a potentially powerful tablet os many of the features weren t really suited for traditional pcs which the majority of users had at the time now finally microsoft has seen the error of its ways and given back the desktop centered windows that power users crave with the windows update the current version of windows is about as good as it can get if you ve been holding out on upgrading now s the time,1

a second time apple says samsung infringed on its patents effectively stealing the key elements of the iphone for a whole range of subsequent samsung smartphones each of which apple is seeking to remove from the market and to get punitive damages for samsung has purchased a few software patents of its own and is wielding those against apple s ios in a kind of rear guard action not a great deal

as briefly as possible didn t we just see this movie in apple won a very similar case against samsung in this exact same courtroom the jury awarded apple billion in damages which the judge later knocked down by a mere million that case is on appeal samsung has not paid anything yet despite hilarious internet rumors that the korean company paid apple entirely in nickels opens in a new window

samsung didn t have those patents it claims apple is infringing last time around in court apple is accusing its rival of patent shopping with malicious intent other than that both sides seem to be gearing up for almost identical arguments to the last trial so far apple is sticking to what worked last time around an emotional appeal to the necessity to protect innovation a stirring narrative about how hard the iphone was to develop samsung s lawyers may use some more fancy footwork this time but their basic argument hasn t changed to punish rival smartphones at this fundamental a level because theirs happen to have the same kinds of curves at its corners for example is to stifle competition apple s five patents at issue here are effectively invalid samsung says this is really a proxy battle for ios vs android right that depends on your point of view apple says no it s just about basic patent infringement and the need to protect creative risk taking samsung says yes because the more it can frame apple as obsessively anti google and anti android the more samsung looks like an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire of silicon valley giants to this end samsung has already pulled out of its sleeve an email in which steve jobs declared holy war against android a priority for apple this is not far from the thermonuclear war jobs threatened to wage on a mobile operating system he considered a blatant theft of apple s property jobs choice of words however may not matter compared to the impossibility of getting a jury in silicon valley that doesn t automatically venerate the local kid what s the endgame here we re looking at weeks possibly months even of arguments before judge lucy koh who is known for her tough manner and colorful turns of phrase she jokingly accused apple lawyers of smoking crack tuesday because they were overly optimistic about how fast the trial would proceed then a jury will decide the winner if there is to be any apple is seeking damages of billion this time around plus banning the offending samsung phones from sale in the u s that latter part didn t fly the last time around and given how many of the phones in question have already been retired anyway it s kind of a losing battle to begin with smartphone cycles are faster than the law and always will be more likely apple is using this as a test case to see if it can fire a warning shot at android smartphone manufacturers force some design changes and claw back some iphone market share in the interim samsung on the other hand is asking for a mere million in damages for the infringement of its patents or as tim cook could call it walking around money for apple what was that about the apple executive and ellen in court on tuesday samsung attorney bill price questioned phil schiller apple s vp of marketing price was trying to grill schiller about those patents samsung says apple infringed which happen to be photo and video patents and asked whether the iphone could take a selfie like ellen degeneres did during the oscars that selfie heard round the world was rather shamelessly associated with the samsung phone on which it was taken schiller may have sensed a trap he told the attorney he wasn t familiar with the most retweeted tweet in history and this came from the regularly tweeting follower pschiller opens in a new window,1

finds evidence of a hidden ocean on saturn s moon,finding liquid water on a celestial body within the solar system is exciting the only thing that is probably more exciting is finding an ocean full of it today such news comes via cassini which has made measurements that show that saturn s moon enceladus has a hidden ocean beneath its icy surface while orbiting saturn in cassini found jets of salty water spewing from the south polar region of enceladus according to luciano iess of sapienza university of rome lead author of the new study published in science opens in a new window the discovery of the jets was unexpected geysers require liquid water and we wouldn t expect enceladus to have any it is too far from the sun to absorb much energy and too small just in diameter to have trapped enough internal energy to keep its core molten the answer to how the water got there might lie in the details of the moon s internal structure water beneath an icy crust the data to understand enceladus s internal structure came from by measuring changes in cassini s speed as it flew close to the moon when passing the denser parts of the moon it sped up by a few extra thousandths of a meter per second that minute change was tracked through recordings of the radio signals cassini was sending to nasa s deep space network station in making such tiny measurements scientists had to filter out other factors that could influence cassini s speed these include pressure on the spacecraft from sunlight the nudge from heat radiating from its nuclear powered electrical generator and the drag of the particles it strikes as it passes through the south polar plumes iess and his colleagues have produced a model of the internal structure of enceladus using the measurements they conclude that there is a core that is roughly in diameter above that lies a thick layer of liquid water which is followed by of ice crust the water layer may extend all the way to the north pole but its thickest part lies at the south pole this diagram illustrates the possible interior of saturn s moon enceladus based on a gravity investigation by nasa s cassini spacecraft and nasa s deep space network reported in april credit nasa jpl caltech it is possible that saturn s powerful gravity is responsible for the liquid water under enceladus s surface its pull could heat up the interior through a process called tidal kneading which involves the slow compression and expansion of the core as the moon rotates through saturn s gravity well after the initial discovery of the plumes cassini s minders put a lot of effort into determining enceladus s internal structure but it still took nearly ten years to do so this is because the time the spacecraft spends around saturn is very valuable and there are lots of other things worth studying cassini can only make a handful of flybys near enceladus while still paying attention to other moons such as titan when approaching enceladus the controllers also had to make a choice about how to study the moon because of a limitation in how cassini s instruments are arranged when making gravitational recordings it needs to point its antenna towards earth but in doing so all its other instruments face away from enceladus of the flybys only three were used to make gravitational recordings after spending eight years in the saturnian system one may think that the measurements are becoming repetitive and that cassini has discovered everything in the reach of its instruments this is far from being true iess said time is running out the evidence adds up to a large and active body of water under enceladus s southern polar region helen maynard casely of australian nuclear science and technology organisation said but she warned it is going to be a long time before we can verify if this ocean is there if ever the plutonium powered spacecraft has enough energy to power itself till the trouble is that in three years it will only be able to make three more flybys of enceladus which is not enough to take more gravity data its end is slated to come when controllers drive it into saturn s atmosphere for incineration because scientists are keen to avoid having it crash into saturn s pristine moons there is a push to send another mission to saturn but jupiter s moon europa might be a better candidate to search for life at in diameter it is much larger than enceladus and in december astronomers spotted water vapor opens in a new window coming from its south pole as well the possibility of finding a large amount of liquid water is exciting because for life to exist as we understand it we need liquid water even on earth whenever such untouched sources of liquid water such as lakes vostok opens in a new window and ellsworth opens in a new window under antarctica are studied there is always the hope that we may discover new forms of life,0

broadcast partners cbs and turner also have something new and special planned for this year s final four team specific broadcasts this means you can tune into tnt or trutv during each game to get an alternate feed featuring intentionally slanted announcers calling the action during the first game tnt will carry florida s teamcast while trutv carries the uconn version during the second game tnt will carry the kentucky slant while trutv carries the wisconsin version sports illustrated s richard deitsch has more information here opens in a new window and now for the final four teams connecticut connecticut coach kevin ollie shouts instructions during the first half of a march madness game against iowa state on march credit frank franklin ii road to the final four the huskies finished the regular season with an overall record of earning them a seven seed in the tournament then they got hot and went on a major upset streak taking out seed st joseph s then two seed villanova then three seed iowa state and finally four seed michigan state to reach the final four one gambler rode some of that hot streak to in winnings why to root for uconn come on man they re the underdogs technically kentucky may have had a slightly worse seeding heading into march madness but kentucky also has the most highly touted freshman class of all time so the huskies are the real no pun intended underdog squad here if that s not enough uconn s year old coach kevin ollie above played under legendary uconn coach jim calhoun in the early and has emerged from his mentor s shadow this season just his second at the helm of the huskies program if that s not enough guard shabazz napier is well on his way to lifetime hero status in the entire northeast the small speedy guard is averaging better than points per game in the tournament and fought through a bloodied nose to lead last weekend s shocking win over michigan state why this might end in tears napier might reach the end of his bag of tricks ollie might get outsmarted by a more veteran coach on the biggest stage this collection of players was never supposed to get this far there are any number of reasons the wheels could all fall off for uconn this weekend which in a way is all the more reason to hope they don t the player you have to watch napier is the only possible choice here he s a warrior and supremely entertaining he deflects comparisons opens in a new window to kemba walker who led a magical uconn title run in but those comparisons are becoming pretty impossible to avoid here are some napier highlights florida florida guard scottie wilbekin celebrates a basket against dayton in their ncaa tournament game on march credit john bazemore road to the final four florida was the tournament s top overall seed so was kind of expected to reach this point in doing so they knocked off seed albany nine seed pittsburgh four seed ucla and seed dayton why to root for florida let s see a truly cohesive team that blends freshman talent with veteran leaders and players who have overcome personal hardships led by a veteran coach who s been at the same school for nearly years what s not to love one could argue that this is exactly how bigtime college basketball is supposed to look why this might end in tears the gators are final four favorites and the pressure might get to them they re also overdue for a loss they haven t been defeated since a gutty guard made a buzzer beating shot to take them down back on dec wait a minute that guard s name was shabazz napier and that team was connecticut uh oh could we see a repeat of something like this the player you have to watch senior point guard scottie wilbekin is florida s best player the southeastern conference player of the year the gators clear cut leader but he nearly didn t even suit up for the team this year in june donovan suspended him from the team indefinitely and encouraged him to transfer wilbekin was only able to stick around after he begged donovan to allow him to stay and to work his way back to the team the new york times opens in a new window reports one final four run later and that seems to be a good call by both parties kentucky kentucky s julius randle goes up for a shot against georgia on march credit john bazemore road to the final four the wildcats have had quite a journey their six man freshman class was touted as the best of all time before the season but when they struggled early they were written off as overhyped and emblematic of everything wrong with modern college hoops now they re peaking at just the the right time they boast march madness wins over nine seed kansas state one seed wichita state four seed louisville and two seed michigan to earn their final four berth why to root for kentucky there s something perfect about the storyline we mentioned six teenagers judged and torn apart by adults for an entire season who come together at just the right moment to prove all the doubters wrong plus kentucky has some of college hoops wildest fans they can get ugly when the wildcats lose but here s someone s unsolicited contribution opens in a new window to coach john calipari s front year earlier this week some guy just stopped at cal s house got out and put this in his yard crazy opens in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â fred foltz ukturkeyhunter april opens in a new window why this might end in tears those freshman are young after all and thats something that could still catch up to them especially if they run into an experienced florida squad in the national title game the player you have to watch freshman power forward julius randle is and pounds of pure beast his skill strength and passion under the hoop are a pleasure to watch this year s final four location means he s returning home to the dallas area for what will almost certainly be his final collegiate games before leaving school early to enter the nba draft wisconsin wisconsin forward sam dekker celebrates during the second half of a third round game against the oregon in the ncaa college basketball tournament saturday march in milwaukee credit morry gash road to the final four the two seed badgers took down seed american seven seed oregon six seed baylor and top seed arizona to get to this point why to root for wisconsin teamwork help defense the two handed chest pass the triple threat stance picture perfect jump shots floor burns make no mistake these badgers have real talent but if your dear old granddad just hates the way young whippersnappers play the game today wisconsin is the final four team with the best shot of convincing him that good basketball still exists why this might end in tears if the kentucky athletes get in a rhythm or if florida starts clicking on all cylinders or if shabazz napier goes on full kemba walker mode then the badgers just might not have the players to stick around they re certainly the least sexy pick here but then again they re probably the most likely team to formulate a baller game plan then execute it to perfection the player you have to watch sam dekker is wisconsin s high flyer but center frank kaminsky is our player to watch he has a great shot out to three point territory and is tough and crafty under the basket helping him make up for less than ideal athleticism he went for points and rebounds to help beat arizona for a final berth last weekend and may have even him earned himself a look from nba teams here are highlights of kaminsky going off for points in a game

internet in cuba things you need to know,a misguided attempt by the u s government to create a twitter like social network in cuba which ended with million spent and just users to show for it has put the state of the internet on the communist island back on the spotlight cuba has long been one of the least connected countries in the world indeed the country rivals north korea in the extent to which it has shut itself out from the internet here are five things you need to know about internet freedom in cuba a country that blogger and cuban dissident yoani sanchez calls the island of the disconnected internet access is the greatest obstacle in roughly of cubans had internet access according to the country s national statistics office opens in a new window and the international telecommunication union but that number is misleading it includes people that can only log into a government controlled intranet of state approved websites only of cubans actually have access to the open internet according to internet freedom watchdog freedom house opens in a new window home connections are practically nonexistent and only government officials academics doctors engineers or regime approved journalists have internet access at work says ellery biddle a researcher who has focused on cuban internet issues for the last six years for everyone else there are expensive government run internet cafes where an hour of connection can cost opens in a new window between and a prohibitive amount of money in a country where the average weekly salary is around where connection is possible the speed is so slow there s very little they can do online but check email and sluggishly surf websites when they do access the internet they try to do really the bare minimum cynthia romero the latin america senior program officer at freedom house tells mashable even computers are hard to come by until cubans were barred from buying their own which explains why cuba s national statistics office reported in that there were only computers in the whole country people reflected in the window line up at a post office as they wait to use the internet service in havana cuba on may credit ramon espinosa but there are creative workarounds with such limited access cubans have employed more creative methods of surfing one of the most popular is for people to download online articles onto thumb drives then pass them around to friends and family this is sometimes called the sneakernet though sanchez calls it the internet without internet a callback to the when cubans used to cook the meat picadillo without meat because of food shortages with one person connecting to the internet a hundred two hundred five hundred or a thousands are actually accessing information sanchez said during a talk opens in a new window embedded below at the google ideas summit in new york city some cubans with internet access sell it to others or share accounts others build their own antennas or use illegal dial up connections but the cuban government clamps down on these efforts with technicians sniffing neighborhoods for ham radios and satellite dishes according to freedom house activists also use alternative ways to tweet like texting or even speak to tweet opens in a new window systems cubans can call a phone number in the u s and record an anonymous message that gets automatically converted to text and shared via twitter or facebook these calls however can cost more than making it an expensive workaround there s actually very little online censorship when so few people have internet access you don t need to censor it that much in terms of blocking content cuba is no china news websites like the new york times or the miami herald are available as are the sites of human rights watch or amnesty international facebook and twitter are accessible youtube is not there is a certain degree of censorship especially when it comes to blogs run by anti government activists like sanchez her blog generation y opens in a new window is inaccessible and so are others like bitã cora cubana and cubanet according to freedom house the cuban government has also been prosecuting and silencing opens in a new window dissident bloggers via arbitrary arrests beatings and intimidation a customer right purchases internet access at a branch

propaganda initiative called operation truth opens in a new window they are tasked with discrediting government critics and promoting the government s agenda the cuban government has always been very good with information and disseminating its version of accounts says romer so now they re starting to venture out more and more into the internet and social media the regime even has its own versions of wikipedia and facebook cuba s online encyclopedia is called ecured opens in a new window but it only has articles and a small number of hand picked editors social red opens in a new window was cuba s short lived response to facebook students gather behind a business looking for a internet signal for their smart phones in havana cuba on april credit ramon espinosa internet surveillance isn t sophisticated but cubans take it for granted the government has a tight control on the country s telecommunications there are only two internet service providers both are state owned cubacel a subsidiary of cuba s telecom authority etecsa is the only cellular carrier with such control cuba doesn t need cutting edge internet surveillance tools but it does have software like avila link opens in a new window which collects private information from public computers and monitors internet activity with real world surveillance so widespread cubans are paranoid that someone may be watching says romero at internet cafes cubans have to provide an id to use a computer making anonymous use of the internet nearly impossible with all that comes self censorship and a sense of resignation there s no expectation of privacy in most aspects of your life says biddle i think people people generally expect,1

the verdict and has not heard directly from cbs i was disappointed aaron houston a strategist at ghost group the company that owns weedmaps told mashable cbs legal department seems to be behind the times they don t seem to recognize that the country has rapidly shifted in this area to a solid majority in favor of marijuana legalization weedmaps will receive a full refund for the ad the site has already been contacted by other companies who are interested in running the spot but houston could not yet confirm any specifics cbs declined to comment and neutron did not respond to a request for

early tuesday morning the daily news opens in a new window first reported but before the ad could go up on the cbs super screen billboard it was pulled by the corporation for review by its legal team i was surprised but not shocked weedmaps ceo justin hartfield told mashable the creative was really tame especially by our standards the ad was purchased by weedmaps opens in a new window a medical

approving the ad which was meant to present marijuana in a professional light even though it doesn t manage the advertising space cbs can review content that it may not be comfortable associating with its brand since its logo appears on the billboard the company said cbs is currently reviewing the weedmaps ad due to the nature of what it is promoting according to a spokesperson weedmaps only found

weedmaps spokesperson neutron originally approached norml about the current ad but since a price in the low five figures wasn t in the organization s budget the opportunity got passed on to weedmaps the spokesperson said a lot of change really needs to happen and this is another flash point in the evolving discussion norml spokesperson erik altieri told mashable referring to the weedmaps ad weedmaps has increased in popularity since it launched in it has seen a growth year over year and had million visitors just last month its time square ad was scheduled to run hours a day for the next

for missing malaysian plane proves how much trash is in our oceans,searchers scouring the waters of the indian ocean off australiaâ s west coast have not yet succeeded in locating the missing malaysian airlines boeing but they have focused global attention on just how many pieces of manmade detritus is floating in our oceans search personnel have referred to the trash which ranges in size as small as a plastic water bottle to as large as a foot long shipping container with different descriptors from garbage to the more unfamiliar and nautical term â œflotsam opens in a new window â although the search area is not located in the famous great pacific ocean â œgarbage patch opens in a new window â it is located at the edge of one of five â œgyresâ where ocean currents and the atmospheric circulation draws in waste like a magnet â œat least this is letting the world know that garbage patches are not confined to the pacific â said captain charles moore whose work first drew the worldâ s attention to the pacific garbage patch â œthe ocean itself has become this plastic soup â moore told mashable â œfamilies seeing this happen must feel terrible that theyâ re being told their deceased relatives and friends are in a garbage patch â moore said moore founded the algalita marine research institute that works to raise awareness and help reduce the amount of plastic pollution that goes into the worldâ s oceans where it can remain for decades such trash harms wildlife damages ships and as seen in the current search for the missing plane can frustrate urgent search and recovery operations studies have shown that about of the trash in the ocean is plastic moore says and that there are probably up to lost shipping containers drifting along with ocean currents around the world pollution can magnify other challenges the oceans face a new climate change report released this week predicts sweeping changes in marine life in the coming decades due to warming and acidifying seas with pollution adding to the stress on marine species according to moore shipping companies do not have to report lost containers when they go overboard despite the fact that they constitute a hazard to other vessels as was driven home in the recent robert redford film â œall is lost opens in a new window â map of the five subtropical gyres around the world credit org according to marcus eriksen the executive director and co founder of the environmental advocacy group gyres trash in such gyres usually drifts with the currents at about the same pace as a person walks this means that if there is aircraft debris in the vicinity of the indian ocean gyre it is likely to be about miles or more away from its original location the gyres have relatively slow moving currents because they are located in areas where high pressure systems tend to dominate the weather leading to light winds and docile seas this can prevent trash from escaping a gyre for months or more for this reason moore likens the gyres to â œa toilet that doesnâ t flush â eriksen who used to work with moore but decided to set out on his own expanded effort to focus attention on all of the worldâ s garbage patches rather than just the massive one in the pacific told mashable that much of the waste in the five subtropical gyres consists of derelict fishing gear in addition to plastic â œbecause itâ s designed to last forever it actually does â eriksen says despite what many people think he says plastic bags donâ t usually make it to the middle of a gyre since they tend to disintegrate into flecks that fish then consume eriksen says that during trips to all five gyres he has come across many low quality durable goods including umbrella handles bottle caps starbucks straws and forks and knives â œitâ s almost like a department store washed ashore when you come into these gyres â eriksen says in eriksen sailed into the bay of bengal from sri lanka and found an unusually large amount of trash floating off the coast of sri lanka and other south asian countries with lax environmental regulations â œit is unreal how much trash is floating in the bay of bengal â he says trash from the bay can cross the equator and enter the indian ocean gyre which partly encompasses the flight search area trash there is most likely coming from a variety of distant places eriksen said including the bay of bengal south asia africa and parts of the southern ocean north of antarctica in fact eriksen said his research indicates that all subtropical gyres are connected with trash moving between them over time â œthose three gyres communicate â he said in june eriksen s group is planning to study plastic pollution in the north atlantic and viking gyres and is running a video contest opens in a new window to bring a member of the public along with them what are the solutions while the current trash problem exists at sea and appears to be worsening as plastics production increases worldwide particularly in nations that donâ t have stringent environmental protections advocates say most of the solutions would need to take place on terra firma back on solid ground typical mid sized debris found in the garbage gyres credit org both eriksen and moore said they are seeking to alter the very paradigm of capitalism regarding manufacturers responsibility for the end disposal of their products they say the plastics industry needs to take responsibility for their products from manufacturing to disposal if youâ re going to make products made of plastic eriksen says â œyouâ ve got to have a plan for its whole life â as moore put it in an interview every item that is built needs to have a â œreincarnation pathwayâ for being reused or broken down in such a way that it cannot wind up traveling the global seas going from gyre to gyre like a baton stuck in an endless relay race such a plan could consist of providing incentives to consumers to return used plastic items for a financial gain much as is currently done with aluminum soda cans similarly eriksen said fishermen could be given a monetary incentive to haul in and return used fishing gear that they find floating in the open ocean also alternatives to plastic items could be used in many settings such as by switching out plastic straws for paper ones at coffee shops like starbucks eriksen says,1

to turn your pipe dreams into prototypes,depending on who you listen to ideas are either bulletproof cheap and powerful or like an unmentionable part of your body everyone has ideas every conference meetup hackathon startup weekend event is filled with people who have ideas but lack the ability to build them countless people are trying to raise funding or get a technical co founder with little more than a few bullet points on a piece of paper it s pointless ideas without execution aren t worth the paper they re written on the difficulty for a lot of people is getting from that idea to something more tangible and it can seem impossible if you don t have any technical or design skills but in fact it s a lot easier than you might think using one or a combination of the tools below will allow you to create a tangible prototype and build something you can use to show a potential co founder colleague customer or investor what your idea is and how it works these tools will allow you to create everything from a clickable version of your sketches to a more fully featured proper prototype which can be used to raise funding gauge interest or validate a potential market they re all things that anyone can download or load up and start using in minutes no technical or design skills are necessary pop opens in a new window almost unbelievably simple pop can sketch out your idea on paper take photos and then make those images clickable within the app it makes it simple to add transitions and export a version so that people can get hands on and start messing around with your idea balsamiq opens in a new window only slightly more complicated than pop balsamiq is a simple wire framing tool in a nutshell it allows you to mock up the user interface of a website app or idea in a few minutes the joy of balsamiq is that it has pre built widgets that you can just drag and drop onto a web or mobile template as a first step in figuring out what your idea should look like you can t go wrong with this one it s usually my first port of call when i m trying to figure out how an idea could work or look keynotopia opens in a new window this is another personal favorite keyntopia is basically a collection of templates for keynote or powerpoint using these templates and the design components that you get as part of the package will allow you to create a pretty sophisticated looking mockup using nothing more than rudimentary presentation design skills if you re more technically minded i e you know how to do a screengrab you can do a lot more best of all you can add clickable areas to your presentation and export it as a clickable prototype in multiple formats fluidui opens in a new window if google and nasa are using a tool it stands to reason that it must be good that s definitely the case with fluidui as with balsamiq and keynotopia there are thousands of built in widgets and components that you can drag and drop onto your design it s easy to share mockups and give people an idea of how your product will work and feel it s also really easy to bring your own elements into the mockups to customize them even more appcooker opens in a new window appcooker allows you to prototype ideas on your ipad import flat images from dropbox box and other services make them clickable with a few taps and export them for people to test perhaps most interestingly appcooker also includes modules that allow you to test revenue assumptions around the app which is always a helpful thing to do proto io opens in a new window not only is proto io unbelievably fast it also has some of the best demo videos in the marketplace at the moment their tool is similar to the apps mentioned above but it also allows you to animate certain elements of the ui which makes for a far nicer looking prototype it also gives the option of getting feedback from testers colleagues and guinea pigs who can annotate your designs and help refine them check out some of the examples on their site to see just how powerful this can be it s particularly worthwhile if you re looking at prototyping something that functions on multiple devices from cameras to consoles

used the internet to quit smoking,i started smoking for the same reasons most people begin the nasty habit i was young and stupid like many teenagers i could care less about the negative aspects of smoking money wasn t yet a burden on my everyday existence the long term effects meant little to nothing and i had myself convinced that quick spritz of spray deodorant and some gum masked the smell well enough the truth was that smoking once a fun and social activity then began to control my life don t get me wrong i still enjoyed smoking in fact i loved smoking smoking was always there for me it helped alleviate stress introduced me to most of my good friends it felt amazing and played a huge role in my daily routine i would sneak a smoke break anywhere i could and living in a city always provided a few moments to puff when waiting for the bus or walking between destinations the beginning of the end at age i was up to a full pack a day sometimes more my family begged me to quit but you can t just tell someone to stop smoking they have to hit rock bottom they have to want it a few years later at age i was living in new york the most expensive city in the united states where cigarette prices are over a pack there was now no way for me to further delay my mountainous six figure student loan debt i simply couldn t afford to smoke anymore and quite frankly i didn t want to then a friend posted an instagram of her timehop opens in a new window app the nostalgia based app allows you to see your photos and social media updates from exactly one year prior someone with whom i had once enjoyed many cigarettes had made it a full year without smoking and i desperately wanted the same credit instagram after some encouragement from friends and family i started to seriously consider quitting for real i had tried a few times before but i had never put any calculated effort towards it i began researching popular methods people use to quit and stumbled upon an online support group on reddit r stopsmoking opens in a new window the encouraging community is a place for redditors who seek motivation to quit and is filled with stories words of encouragement and advice a yellow badge appears next to your username with a number signifying the number of days since quitting credit reddit once i immersed myself in the subreddit i found that the community extremely friendly and helpful unlike other places on the internet there were no trolls or hateful words toward those who sought advice i quit although i had yearned to quit and had done some research in the method and practice i thought best for me i never picked a specific time to quit but when i awoke on new year s day with a splitting headache reeking of an ash tray i figured now was as good a time as ever the hangover alone was enough to make me not want to smoke so i knew the first day wouldn t be so bad searching for methods to quit smoking on the internet is like searching for weight loss tips there are thousands of different approaches that all claim to be the best but not all is right for you credit itunes app store the patch seemed too weird for me the gum made my mouth itch prescription medication was definitely out i had no insurance e cigarettes hadn t caught on yet and reading a self help book just made me feel like a drug addict which i was one method that did peak my interest was apps along with cigarettes my phone was the only other thing i couldn t leave my apartment without and now it was my only clutch there are hundreds of apps geared towards quitting smoking i downloaded an app called quitit opens in a new window because it had good ratings it was free and wasn t as invasive or time consuming as some others the app is geared toward information as motivation you plug in the amount of cigarettes you smoke cost per pack and the time you quit smoking the app does the math and delivers you information based on your specifics the status screen tracks the amount of time since you quit the money you ve saved cigarettes not smoked and the tar associated with that number the app also includes a number of health goals which monitors your progress as time continues credit quitit utilizing the app quitting smoking was one of the hardest things i ve ever had to do like most quitting stories i did get a little sick i was irritable and i felt terrible but the most difficult part was the empty feeling i was left with i felt as if nothing was ever going to be the same any activity i had once enjoyed while smoking was simply never going to be as good as it was with a cigarette in hand my morning coffee just wasn t like it was before i drank alone inside bars as my friends braved the cold weather for their vice and even though my appetite did increase meals weren t as satisfying without a cigarette for dessert any time i had a craving i would open the app and track the progress i had made if i had a craving while i was on the computer i d immediately go to r stopsmoking to read a success story or to offer someone else having a harder time than me support it was like complaining about a sprained ankle at the doctor s office when the person next to you doesn t have any legs at all after just a week or two i started to notice a difference in my health and hygiene especially in my mouth once the initial shock wore off sleeping became easier although occupied with strange lucid dreams and i began to think about cigarettes less and less credit reddit the app worked for me because of its no nonsense vibe the ads are small and barely noticeable it isn t overloaded with features and functions it loads quickly and isn t a battery killer other apps like kwit opens in a new window use game design techniques to encourage quitting credit kwit the app livestrong opens in a new window which calls itself a myquit coach combines game design community and motivational information it was a little frustrating to use however and the popups just made me want to smoke more credit livestrong a lot of apps also feature the humble social media brag element allowing you to connect your social media accounts to the app for me the thought of failure was worse once i boasted to my followers about how far i had come with my addiction i quit smoking year months days ago i did not smoke cigarettes and saved â brian koerber bkurbs march opens in a new window not smoking is still an everyday struggle and probably will be for the rest of my life although my quitit opens in a new window app slowly moved from the home screen on my iphone to the third screen back among other forgotten and hardly used apps i have no desire to delete it still the only time i ever open it is when someone asks how much money i ve saved since quitting,0

cortana how microsoft s answer to siri was born,i ve just told my new personal assistant that she sucks she responds very calmly telling me that my outburst may result in early onset rampancy before giving me the silent treatment she s not really my personal assistant of course and she doesn t actually suck her name is cortana microsoft s new voice enabled virtual assistant for windows phone and i ve been trying to stump her with some offbeat requests generally she s been doing ok although like her cousins siri and google now cortana will shunt me to a list of search results if she can t figure out what i m saying but she often surprises me with spurts of cleverness microsoft has clearly prepared her with plenty of semi sassy statements to amuse users when they decide to have a little fun with her and they will the microsoft team researched how people were interacting with windows phone s current fairly primitive voice commands they found that more than was what microsoft describes as chitchat semi silly requests like tell me a joke or where are you from the chitchat statistic helped guide microsoft s overall approach to building cortana creating a service perhaps the better word is entity that really gets to know its user so it doesn t just react to requests once she gets to know you cortana can anticipate what you ll ask and serve up information before you even do so the human factor while the chitchat is basically canned answers it meets an expectation on the user s part that the assistant should seem at least somewhat human if cortana talks to users in a natural conversational way they will probably want to talk to her more thus microsoft dedicated a whole team to creating chitchat answers how cortana will answer if you tell her you love her credit mashable karissa bell microsoft also added a brilliant differentiator people reminders while ios and android can tie reminders to specific times and places with cortana windows phone is the only mobile platform that can attach reminders to individuals remind me to ask dave about the new house next time i talk to him people were using standard reminder apps to do things that were associated with a person said microsoft s marcus ash program manager for the cortana team the problem is the reminder wouldn t fire when you re actually talking to them so we thought why not make it fire when you talk to the person but it s the anticipatory philosophy behind cortana that really makes her tick not to mention differentiates her from siri whereas apple s assistant is centered around voice control and only appears when you call upon her cortana is more than just voice she s looking at your calendar your contacts and even your email to make connections and serve up information when it makes sense for example if you ask cortana about the weather every day around the same time after a few days she ll suggest telling you the weather at that time without you even asking likewise if you text someone often cortana might ask if that contact should be added to your favorites list called the inner circle what people want is something that has context ash said bringing in this proactive i can anticipate what you want felt like the future to us you can certainly say no and microsoft said that cortana won t look at any of your data you don t want her to in fact if you want her to just behave like siri with no getting to know you factor you can choose that too avoiding creepiness making cortana s anticipatory features purely opt in lets microsoft avoid accusations of hypocrisy in light of its scroogled campaign that criticized google for reading people s emails to customize ads now that microsoft is creating its own services powered by personal data it s walking a fine line people can be delighted by systems that do things on your behalf but you have to make sure this stuff isn t creepy ash said the customer has to feel like they re in control of the system not the other way around in cortana s case it may be worth it while google is also dedicating a lot of resources to natural language processing and context based requests such as search results that factor in your last search the result isn t quite as personal google now serves up some great data but you wouldn t think to ask about its thoughts on larry page helping cortana seem human is the human behind her voice jen taylor opens in a new window cortana is named after the holographic assistant from the halo universe and taylor has been voicing her since the first game title back in she does the chitchat answers and key phrases but because of the sheer amount of recording needed taylor s voice is supplemented by others she s going to be the voice of cortana ash said she does all the chit chat now for other it s a hybrid of voices but we re working with jen to replace our overall voice cortana at least the beta version will make her debut in windows phone with an official release later in april while microsoft s digital assistant is coming late to the party its big picture personalized approach could be a key long term differentiator the future is really in a learning system getting so good that it gives you insights about yourself that you don t even realize ash said that s been our long term vision it will take years for that vision to be realized but a device that can offer just the right information by anticipating your needs and knowing your context sometimes assisted by beacons is approaching the behavior of a living breathing personal assistant cortana will probably never save the world with master chief but she s definitely a personality the future could fall in love with,0

wars vine vs instagram facebook twitter snapchat,itâ s been hard to ignore the meteoric rise of the private messaging industry over the past two months first came facebook s jaw dropping billion purchase of standalone messaging service whatsapp in february chat app viber was acquired opens in a new window by rakuten for million then messaging startup tango raised million in march a funding round that valued the company at more than billion according to forbes opens in a new window so it s no surprise that social media platforms the ones that view messaging as a supplemental feature have been busy keeping up on thursday vine released vine messages the app s first foray into private messaging it s a competitive move to keep up with facebook whose messenger and instagram apps both offer private messaging and snapchat so how can you tell these services apart and what are their pros and cons here s our quick primer vine messages history launched april pros includes vine video production features stop motion grid lines send text and or video messages send messages to people who arenâ t on vine cons canâ t create group messages canâ t send still images only videos canâ t send videos from camera roll best use case sending a creative video overview vine is the latest social platform to unveil private messaging and its unrivaled video capabilities stop motion grid lines should make it popular for video messages but users canâ t send videos from their camera roll and the absence of group messages puts vine messaging at a disadvantage vine unveiled private messaging thursday but only time will tell how the new service fits in with other messaging competitors credit kurt wagner mashable instagram direct history launched december pros add filters to photos or videos send text and or video messages send group messages send existing photos and videos from the camera roll cons canâ t message people outside of instagram no stop motion video like vine photos must be cropped as square group messages limited to people best use case sending artsy pictures or videos with filters overview instagram unveiled its messaging feature to lots of fanfare in december but little has been said about it since there was some news yesterday but it wasnâ t positive actor james franco used instagram direct to connect to a year old fan the feature certainly doesnâ t detract from instagram it just doesnâ t add enough to make it a major player instagram unveiled private messaging in december credit kurt wagner mashable facebook messenger history launched august pros send individual or group messages save favorite or often used groups for future use free phone calls to facebook friends using wi fi can send photos from camera roll cons canâ t send video messages canâ t take pics through the app no filters for photos canâ t message people who are not on facebook best use case connecting with facebook friends whose phone numbers youâ ve lost overview this is the most robust app in the bunch messenger was poised for a big year in facebook redesigned the app and made it faster more like texting in october and mark zuckerberg mentioned messenger multiple times during the companyâ s earnings call then facebook bought standalone messaging app whatsapp for billion begging the question where does messenger fit in messenger supports free phone calls over wi fi making it another facet of zuckerberg s attempt to connect the world online facebook messenger was upstaged somewhat by the company s billion whatsapp acquisition in february credit kurt wagner mashable twitter direct messages history launched november opens in a new window pros send text and or picture messages take pictures through the app or send photos from the camera roll filters and photo editing tools cons canâ t create group messages canâ t send videos can only send messages to people who follow you can only receive messages from people you follow messages limited to characters best use case continuing a twitter exchange in private overview twitter dms have been part of the service from the start itâ s surprising then that the feature has not evolved more over the past eight years you can send picture messages as of december but you canâ t send videos you canâ t create group messages and each individual message is limited to characters itâ s a rather simple offering the rules about who you can message are helpful you wonâ t get spammed by people you donâ t follow but they are also limiting there seems to be lots of room for growth here and we expect twitter to do just that down the road twitter added picture messages in december but the messaging feature remains basic compared to competitors credit kurt wagner mashable snapchat history launched july pros messages disappear send anything you want can send picture or video messages can draw or doodle on messages or include a typed message can save snaps for hours if wanted cons messages disappear donâ t send stuff you want to save people can screen grab your images and they will trust us text is limited canâ t fit more than characters usually fewer canâ t send text only messages canâ t create ongoing group messages best use case sending goofy or inappropriate photos and videos overview there isnâ t much pressure with snapchat which is a good thing you arenâ t going to use the service for serious back and forth messaging and group messaging doesnâ t exist you can send stuff thatâ s fun goofy or inappropriate and know that it will exist for just a short time on the receiving end the danger of course is that recipients can screen grab your photos if you want so go crazy but not too crazy or get some more trustworthy friends,0

colbert is cbs top choice to succeed letterman and he s into it,update april p m et cbs confirmed that stephen colbert will take over david letterman s slot on the late show stephen colbert is cbs top choice to replace the retiring david letterman and has indicated that he s willing to take over the late show when the time comes people familiar with both sides of the discussions tell mashable colbert has not had any formal contract discussions with cbs and no agreement is in place but sources tell mashable that he first engaged with network executives while letterman was still mulling the timing of his retirement though cbs has had conversations with other candidates including colbert s comedy central counterpart jon stewart individuals with knowledge of the situation say colbert is currently the front and center candidate a cbs spokesman told mashable â œweâ re not commenting on any rumors or speculation about succession â comedy central had no comment colbert s contract to host the colbert report on comedy central runs through the end of which would free him up in time to move over to cbs when letterman ends his year run in late night tv letterman left the exact date of his departure vague while announcing his retirement plans on thursday â œwe donâ t have the timing of this precisely down it will be at least a year or so letterman said on thursday s episode of the late show but at some time in the not too distant future â for the love of god colbert would leave behind the pseudo conservative persona he s cultivated at the colbert report and just be himself at his cbs home one of the individuals told mashable he has stepped out of character on rare occasion though not on his show and possesses the same wry incisive interview skills that letterman has showcased for decades a few questions remain for cbs in its pursuit of colbert money is a big one the gap between a potential network payday and a comedy central salary has significantly narrowed in recent years plus colbert is meticulously topical in his selection of guests many of whom aren t stars but the late show gig would force him to shoot the breeze with all manner of celebrities peddling movies and tv shows that isn t to say he wouldn t do it well but would he want to there s also more of a workload five nights a week to cover an hour versus four nights doing minutes but in the end the draw of being letterman s replacement could be too strong for colbert who is a friend and admirer of letterman s these conversations represent the state of play at this time but anything can happen in letterman s remaining year twitter and facebook were filled with calls to diversify the mostly white male late night lineup and colbert still has more than eight months left on his comedy central contract other names that have come up in discussions for letterman s replacement have included neil patrick harris who just finished up how i met your mother on cbs and craig ferguson who comes on after the late show with david letterman harris could remain a wild card but ferguson though well liked by the network in his later slot on the late late show with craig ferguson has never been seen as the heir apparent at one point stewart was seriously considered for the late show post but his prospects have steadily faded over time as sentiment coalesced around colbert the daily show host has finished shooting his feature film directorial debut rosewater and is said to be passionate about continuing that and other off air pursuits which a major late night hosting job would not easily permit cbs is a cousin of comedy central via viacom from which the broadcast network was spun off in stewart and colbert enjoy similar ratings but the daily show is still considered comedy central s flagship program which would make a stewart poach potentially more fraught colbert who will celebrate his birthday next month made his bones as a correspondent on stewart s show leaving in to start his spinoff series that immediately follows it the shows have essentially gone hand in hand ever since with the two hosts joining forces for special election coverage and other events the colbert report has won emmys for writing for a variety music or comedy program in and it won its first outstanding variety series emmy last year snapping a year run for stewart s show see also stephen colbert breaking character will reduce you to giggles though cbs has been quietly lining up his replacement for months by all accounts letterman s decision to leave was entirely his own and was largely telegraphed when he signed a one year contract extension to remain through since then the year old letterman had been having ongoing conversations with cbs ceo leslie moonves who released the following statement after letterman s announcement thursday when dave decided on a one year extension for his most recent contract we knew this day was getting closer but that doesnâ t make the moment any less poignant for us for years david letterman has graced our networkâ s air in late night with wit gravitas and brilliance unique in the history of our medium during that time dave has given television audiences thousands of hours of comedic entertainment the sharpest interviews in late night and brilliant moments of candor and perspective around national events heâ s also managed to keep many celebrities politicians and executives on their toes â including me there is only one david letterman his greatness will always be remembered here and he will certainly sit among the pantheon of

basketball hunger games where you could win,imagine march madness street ball viral marketing and the hunger games all rolled into one then add a big fat pot of gold at the end that s essentially the premise behind the basketball tournament opens in a new window called tbt for short a single elimination five on five hoops tournament its teams will be culled to one champion and that champion will be rewarded with a no strings attached wire transfer of it s open to anyone collegians pros you me who can recruit enough votes for their team on the tbt website online voting is already well underway and runs until may then most of the tournament runs from june to followed by a two week break before the championship on june the most appealing things about march madness are the high stakes the win or go home format and how you can read the emotion of the players tournament founder jonathan mugar tells mashable we wanted to couple that with this idea that any elite or non elite player could enter that the format could be opened up so that absolutely anyone who wants to play can play it started with a text mugar is a year old former division iii basketball player who now works as a tv producer one morning about three years ago he woke up and texted his buddy dan friel a simple question what do you think would happen if someone just threw a bunch of prize money together and put on a basketball tournament that was open to anybody in the world fast forward to today and that s exactly what the two pals are doing mugar has laid aside tv work friel is taking a leave of absence from his job as an assistant united states attorney in louisiana prosecuting public corruption and fraud related to hurricane katrina outside investors who for now at least request to remain anonymous have ponied up the prize money now all that s left is to stage the actual tournament and watch the online votes pile up and determine who gets to compete the terrifying thing with an open tourney is you have no control over who s gonna enter and no control over who s gonna win mugar says these teams are legit terry dehere general manager of tbt team st anthony drives to the basket in an nba on nov credit rich pedroncelli if you think it s just a bunch of social media nerds who have entered the voting fray so far think again more than teams have entered doing so is free and more than have already qualified for possible inclusion by gathering registered fans on the tbt website the top vote getters are automatically entered regardless of actual ability and then eight more will be picked by tbt officials based on a variety of factors to fill out the team field but there are more twists here too rosters don t have to be finalized until may when voting ends so some enterprising campaigner could hypothetically build a huge vote lead then auction off spots on his team just before the roster deadline teams are tasked with deciding among themselves how to divvy up the winning prize should they be victorious each player s salary is listed on his team page rosters are maxed at players and one supporter now a moment to highlight some of the more interesting entrants opens in a new window that have qualified so far cornell sweet sixteen opens in a new window remember that cornell team that made an improbable march madness run in they re baaack this time in tbt many of the team s best players have reunited for another shot at glory spurred by smart team first basketball talk about old school st anthony opens in a new window st anthony is a catholic high school in jersey city that has produced several nba players and dozens of college stars over the past three decades under legendary coach bob hurley sr but the school is also a bit strapped for cash so this team comprised of st anthony alumni is entered as a non profit participant with the idea of raising money for st anthony and awareness of its plight the full roster hasn t been revealed yet but alum terry dehere who played six years in the nba is already signed on as general manager barstool sports philly opens in a new window barstool sports is a popular sports blog that s entered a team of its own they haven t filled out their full roster yet either but they appear off to a solid start with a small forward and power forward already on board given the site s popularity among young males however finding some ringers should be no problem at all air force bomb squad opens in a new window this squad is made of guys who played in college at the air force academy all of them have or are currently serving as active duty air force officers and their page on the tbt site says the tournament will be used to provide a much needed reunion between former teammates they also say they ll donate a significant portion of their earnings to charity or the air force hoops program provided of course that they win then there s showtime opens in a new window a team made of up of basketball mad former high school and small college players that has surged to fourth place in online fan voting how in part by hitting the streets of virginia where they re based and handing out fliers imploring locals to help them make the tourney by voting online where do we go from here credit tbt rosters are locked and the top teams in fandom voting are automatically entered in the basketball tournament on may the final eight will be selected mugar says based on talent level fan outreach effort and backstory so a team like st anthony or air force bomb squad presumably would move to the front of the line if they didn t qualify on votes alone then it all goes down at philadelphia university round is june the second and third rounds are june then the semifinals are june win a game and advance lose a game and go home during the more than two week break between the semifinals and june final a fan vote will determine which finalist will host the championship game and how long the championship game s shot clock should be with on the line it s also a good bet the final two teams will use that time to strategize and practice at this point if you re anything like me your main question is how in the name of god do i watch this thing as of now you can t but mugar says you should be able to he and friel and their anonymous partners are still in the process of finalizing tbt s longterm business and marketing plans they d ideally like to make it an annual thing as for how you might be able to watch this june mugar says one option in particular would be most appropriate i really love the idea of streaming the games mugar tells mashable it just fits the idea of what we re trying to do so perfectly make a basketball tournament that s truly open to all and then bring it to basketball s biggest fans wherever they are bonus posterized youtube s most epic nba dunks,1

fire tv is a great living room companion,is amazon s fire tv the ultimate living room device it s not perfect but it certainly has potential amazon unveiled its fire tv set top box on wednesday to a market already crowded with players both big and small the company s goal with fire tv is not to merely compete with the likes of roku and apple but also to bring its full ecosystem of content including games to the living room in a lot of ways fire tv is everything google tv should have been but wasn t yes google tv was supposed to integrate with live tv but that never worked well instead fire tv is a great example of bringing the world of mobile apps and games to television in a way that makes sense and is easy to use so does fire tv live up to the hype we ve spent a few days putting the device through its paces design and specs amazon did a terrific job with the design of the fire tv the box itself is square nondescript and remarkably thin unlike the apple tv and roku the fire tv doesn t have curved edges this thing is sharp but the overall look is sleek and discreet although the fire tv is small and thin its height is about the diameter of a dime around three quarters of an inch it has more heft in it than you may expect the fire tv isn t heavy per se but you can definitely tell that amazon has packed tons of stuff into this box amazon is really hyping the power of the fire tv focusing on its quad core processor and dedicated gpu during the company s presentation i remarked that the fire tv was basically a kindle fire hdx tablet without the screen looking at ifixit

processor and of ram this is the same chipset used in the galaxy and the htc one this isn t quite as high end as the snapdragon found in the kindle fire hdx but it s considerably more powerful than any of the other current crop of set top box low cost gaming systems on the market from a specs perspective the only aspect that feels limiting about the fire tv is its internal storage the fire tv has of flash storage which can be used to store games and other apps this will be fine for most users but if you find yourself using the fire tv to play lots of games we can see getting filled up very very quickly i ll discuss this in depth later on but some games can be over which means it would be possible to fill up the fire tv with under games installed in a perfect world the fire tv would have an sd or microsd slot to make it easy to expand storage in terms of ports the fire tv is fully loaded it has an hdmi port optical audio output and ethernet there is also a usb port although that isn t enabled to do anything at the moment except for debugging and interfacing in developer mode like the apple tv and roku the fire tv is hdmi only so if you have an older tv without an hdmi port it won t work setup setting up the fire tv is remarkably simple plug the watt power adaptor into the unit connect it to an hdmi cable not included put batteries in the included remote and that s it there is no power button on the device to turn it off unplug it from the wall or the power adaptor once the unit is on it will search for the bluetooth remote if it doesn t find it after a few seconds the on screen menu helpfully explains what to press on the remote to get things paired once paired the next step is to walk through the setup process although amazon has made a big deal out of its voice search and how the fire tv removes the need to hunt and peck to enter information when it comes to setting up your wi fi network you have to do just that the fire tv does support wi fi direct so if your router has that feature enabled you can set up with less fuss otherwise yes you will need to enter in your password using an on screen keyboard setting up the fire tv is a snap credit for both wired and wireless connections users can alter the ip gateway and dns address so if you have some specific networking needs the fire tv is surprisingly robust when you buy a fire tv it can come pre registered to your amazon account this means that as soon as the unit boots up it has access to your purchased or rented amazon videos is tied to your amazon credit card and can plug into amazon cloud drive photos if you don t have an amazon prime subscription you can get a free day trial it s worth noting however that the fire tv is really designed around prime instant and amazon s ecosystem in general voice search great when you can use it one of the hallmark features of the fire tv is its innovative voice search this isn t the first time we ve seen voice search in the living room the original kinect for xbox had it and it s a prominent feature on the xbox one however this is the first time we ve seen voice search integrated into a device at the fire tv s price point use voice search by holding down a microphone button on the bluetooth remote and saying your search selection out loud release the button and a search takes place voice recognition is good on the fire tv i very rarely found myself having to repeat my phrase or search query but it s not perfect still it was reliable enough to use as a primary search method in addition to searching for titles of movies and tv shows you can search for actors directors and genres searching for oscar winners for instance will bring up films such as the silence of the lambs while searching for cop shows brings up nypd blue want to search the fire tv just talk to it credit if content is available on another service you can select a more ways to watch button to see other viewing options for a show here s the problem right now the only other service supported by voice search is hulu plus if i search for scandal for example i see the episodes available on amazon instant and hulu plus the problem is that amazon s episodes aren t available for free netflix however has the first two seasons of scandal available for free but that does not come up in my voice search amazon said it wants to work with all content providers to bring their content to voice search but for now it s really only designed to work with amazon content that s a shame because a unified search option using voice or not is something sorely needed roku has done a lot to integrate unified search into its software in recent builds the xbox one and tivo roamio have great unified search features too for now voice search is great but it s not universal which means you ll still need to hunt and peck in other apps and in other parts of the system third party services the fire tv is based on android albeit a customized version similar to what amazon uses for the kindle fire hdx tablets as a result all of the third party services and apps are actually android apps running on the tv this means netflix hulu plus crackle pandora and others are actually android apps i mention this because although the android interface usually works well for a foot experience it isn t as good as the version of those services for other set top box and internet tvs netflix for example has a really great interface that runs on roku certain blu ray players and the playstation and that experience is in my mind superior to the android app blown up to fit a big screen i m being really nitpicky here however because third party services work as expected what s more out of the box amazon has a great selection of third party services including nearly every major video service in north america the one exception is hbo go hbo go is available on roku apple tv xbox playstation and several other devices fire tv supports showtime anytime but not hbo go that said the android nature of the device means that bringing support for other services should be simple the amazon fire tv also supports third party apps such as hulu plus credit mashable christina ascani it s important to note that because content channels tend to be siloed voice search does not work within those apps and there isn t a unified way to view content or playlists from across various services to me that would be the only thing amazon could do to upgrade the experience watching content from other services proved solid i found netflix buffered a bit more on the fire tv than on my roku or apple tv but i haven t had enough time to do extensive tests to investigate the cause with hulu plus i did have some issues playing back some content in the app felicity wouldn t play back on the fire tv but it worked fine on an ipad roku apple tv and chromecast that was the only show that gave me issues and i ve reported the problem to both amazon and hulu plus games streaming content aside the real differentiator with the fire tv is that it is also a bonafide game machine no the fire tv doesn t compete with the likes of an xbox one or playstation but ouya gamestick and other android based game devices should be worried very worried games for the fire tv are android ports from the amazon appstore modified to work well on a large screen and with a game controller or the amazon remote the bluetooth game controller doesn t come with the fire tv but is available for this price includes amazon coins to use toward buying games or in app purchases other bluetooth controllers will work with the fire tv as well including models from moga the amazon fire tv game controller is available for credit mashable christina ascani amazon can t guarantee that every bluetooth android controller will work with the fire tv but the company isn t doing anything overtly proprietary in what it supports i think that s really fantastic especially for existing moga owners we ll test more bluetooth controllers with the fire tv in the future and post our results up to four controllers can be connected to the fire tv at once but i only played with one controller connected as for the controller itself it s nice while it s not as perfect as an xbox xbox one controller what is it feels good in the hand the buttons are responsive the analog sticks are solid and i noticed no discernible input lag when playing games on the tv the controller can also control the fire tv itself so you can use it to easily make your way around the general entertainment console as for the number of compatible games amazon has a large list opens in a new window that will only continue to grow playing asphalt gameloft s racing game on the big screen was a pure joy sev zero is a new exclusive fire tv game from amazon game studios that is part tower defense part first person shooter it s a ton of fun and a great way to show off the power of the fire tv the fire tv plays minecraft well credit mashable christina ascani other games including telltale games fantastic the walking dead look great on the system that said games optimized for the controller work don t work as well as you might expect crazy taxi is one of my favorite games of all time i love the mobile version on ios and android i was so excited to play it on the big screen but the experience was incredibly disappointing although the controller works with the game switching from drive to reverse requires some on screen toggling before the sticks will work well the controller support was added in such a way that made me think sega didn t put a lot of time into it i m a forgiving customer who doesn t mind that my purchase for a game i ve already bought four times if you include dreamcast xbox ios and android had a less than stellar controller experience but i can see a lot of users getting frustrated by situations like that i urge game developers to ensure their games work well with the fire tv controller don t just do a quick remapping job storage woes downloading some of the larger games including asphalt means that it s very easy to fill up the of internal storage on the fire tv it s also easy to uninstall games from the fire tv but i think that the more people use the fire tv as a place to play games the less they will want to uninstall them i m confident that its limited storage and lack of microsd or sd was because amazon needed to keep costs down that s perfectly acceptable and for most users won t be a major issue still i hope some solution be it adding external usb support or some sort of cloud play option for select games is in the works i harp on the storage point only because i do think amazon has something really special with the fire tv this is the first commercial product i ve seen that can bring the casual mobile gaming experience to television one of the biggest challenges facing ouya and others like it is getting a good selection of aaa games from big developers in a storefront that people can trust amazon solves that problem while also having the resources to invest in its own gaming brand who is this for the fire tv s dashboard credit mashable christina ascani some of the negative reviews on amazon com for the fire tv lament the lack of access to local media files and the inability to connect to an external usb device to those users i say i understand your frustration although plex for android is available and that s one solution but the fire tv isn t being billed as that type of device the fire tv has the potential to be tweaked hacked and customized beyond any other major streaming box on the market but it is very clearly meant for people who want to enjoy streaming content from a variety of services along with the ability to play games on their television the fire tv achieves those goals beautifully especially at amazon fire tv the good great content selection can play games well competitive price the bad voice search only works with amazon content not all games are optimized well for the controller content support nonexistent for non u s users the bottom line the amazon fire tv brings all of the company s content ecosystem to the living room for just this is what google tv should have been,1

in five minutes he also set a new record in the process by memorizing names and faces in minutes and yet dellis doesn t claim to have a photographic memory or any other unusual brain powers besides

details his not so secret training regime on his blog opens in a new window seven decks of cards memorized each day as well as a sequence of random words names digits and lines of poetry that s more than one million bits of data memorized each year by his own calculations dellis techniques which were chronicled in the documentary ben franklin blowing bubbles at a sword the journey of a mental athlete opens in a new window also include associating numbers and cards with an action person or object he cobbles those images together as needed which creates a distinct mental picture that facilitates memory nelson dellis credit wikimedia commons a former software developer dellis was inspired to train his mind when doctors diagnosed his grandmother josephine with alzheimer s disease i have this memory of sitting at a table having dinner with her my grandfather and me and she said when is nelson coming here dellis told cnn opens in a new window in i was sitting right in front of her it never hit me like that dellis began researching mnemonic techniques online soon after and eventually competed in the usa memory championships he failed to place in the contest however so he refocused his energies on another passion mountain climbing when his grandmother passed away later that year dellis decided to renew his efforts in memory training and intertwine the two interests never one to do things halfway i get very obsessive with things that i m working on he says mountain climbing would become a major part of his mission to honor his grandmother s memory he won his first memory championship in and repeated the victory the next year when he also ranked seventh in the world memory championships opens in a new window in the process he broke two national records by memorizing a full deck of shuffled cards in seconds and digits in just five minutes his training regimen reportedly opens in a new window included memorizing a randomly shuffled deck of cards while

tournament of his own dubbed the extreme memory tournament opens in a new window with a goal of making memory sport a lot more engaging for the audience he says taking place at the end of this month in san diego the tournament will feature a series of rapid fire memorization events designed to break down every event into short exciting head to head memory battles dellis has enlisted of the world

techniques can help fight off opens in a new window the effects of alzheimer s so even a little of his secret sauce goes a long way my thinking is when i m older and starting to get a little weaker in

his throne i m pretty confident that most people won t train that hard he says i guess there will be someone eventually if you re planning to give dellis a run for his money the graphic below will

windows a mistake microsoft seems to think so,microsoft showed off the future of windows this week at its build developer conference and it looks pretty retro in fact it looks a lot like windows during a tease of some possible new features in a future update microsoft s executive vice president of operating systems terry myerson revealed a tool that users will recognize from previous versions of windows a start menu he also showed that users would soon be able to run modern aka metro apps those apps you buy in the windows store with touch oriented full screen interfaces within individual windows on the desktop in other words it s exactly how windows used to work honestly i m not really surprised said one build attendee a developer from a major software company who didn t want to be named the new ui hadn t really caught on there was a lot of user backlash and let s be honest metro apps aren t the biggest draw microsoft was going in this direction already the latest windows update reasserts some of the old school desktop tools such as the windows taskbar as well as buttons for close and minimize which will now appear in modern apps a new start menu along with windows for modern apps takes the windows retrograde to another level it s tantamount to an admission from microsoft that the approach it took with windows was a mistake that tiled touch first interfaces simply don t work very well on traditional pcs like laptops that wasn t the party line when microsoft debuted windows in the fall of at the time the design philosophy implied desktop tools like the start menu and taskbar were antiquated in an ever connected world and signposts such as permanent icons for power and search were simply unnecessary just noisy chrome that distracts you from whatever you happen to be doing that s dead wrong according to user experience designer jesse james garrett chief creative officer of adaptive path opens in a new window a design consulting firm garrett believes the whole approach of windows was broken from the start it was just too different he said i think they made a lot of decisions that make complete sense if you re bringing a completely new tablet os to market but the pc experience is loaded with expectations that go back decades that was completely up ended by what they put in front of people killing the start menu is probably the most revealing example of why microsoft s approach irritated users in windows the start screen was intended to be a supercharged version of start menu adapting it for touch with smart visual notifications in the form of live tiles seemed like an idea that couldn t lose the was a touchstone an anchor you could always come back to garrett said the start screen isn t an obvious analog to the start menu it s visually so complex that people get lost without the anchor it creates friction for users microsoft appears to have seen the error it made in merging a touch experience with a mouse and keyboard machine it began to reverse course in windows bringing back the start button although it only served to return to the start screen and giving users the option to boot to the desktop microsoft showed off a new version of the windows start menu at its build developer conference credit mashable pete pachal with the update and the future changes myerson showed microsoft is separating its conjoined os twins even further windows as a desktop interface will be more or less back to normal tablets will remain modern first i think the initial idea to combine desktop and tablet was a mistake because it assumed that tablets would be the next evolution of the desktop said coty beasley a senior user experience designer with the national association of insurance commissioners that idea certainly didnâ t take hold in the way microsoft was expecting the tablet dilemma did it have to be this way why didn t microsoft just launch modern metro as a tablet only os and leave the desktop well enough alone as a counterexample apple never tried to unite a tablet and desktop interface ceo tim cook even famously compared the hybrid devices that resulted from such a pairing to refrigerator toasters some ui elements from ios have made their way into os x but the ipad a decidedly different ecosystem from the mac and os x this approach has worked out pretty well microsoft was in a completely different market position however it wanted needed to jump start its tablet platform and it decided that leveraging the full power of the company s windows developer base was the best way unfortunately pc users were taken along for what ended up being a bumpy ride i think the problem with windows all along has been that nothing about it was driven by user need garrett said donâ t get me wrong i think they did a great job in creating a touch ui but coupling it with a legacy desktop didn t make sense microsoft s windows experiment wasn t necessarily a complete disaster it hasn t helped pc sales but it did generate developer interest in modern apps and it let microsoft unite all of its consumer facing platforms under a single standard called universal windows apps now if you develop for windows of the code is the same when go from one kind of device to another according to steve guggenheimer microsoft s vice president of developer platform and evangelism modern age however if microsoft keeps shrinking the presence of the modern ui on desktop pcs the kinds of machines that constitute the vast majority of windows devices on the market what incentive will there be for developers to keep working there the big advantage on metro now is you can re use the code for mobile devices and platforms said alexander kohler a developer for direct mail house i can address many more platforms now than i could before developing an app now isn t about metro or not metro it s about how many clients am i going to address kohler is hinting at other side to the argument if modern apps will soon be able to run within windows desktop users just might start downloading them a few might even pay for the privilege it seems people who use windows don t use metro apps a ton said kellen sunderland who does development for nokia and videolan project which makes the vlc player so targeting mouse and keyboard users should drive up those adoption rates running modern apps in a desktop window may be a tough sell for users modern evernote for example is optimized for touch with simplified tiles and icons just like you d want on a tablet it s difficult to see the advantage for a desktop user over say the web app given those different experiences once the start menu is back and the desktop is king again microsoft may find itself back in the same position it was in before windows with a big desktop user base that sees little to no value in having a windows tablet ecosystem present on their machines the troubled story of windows isn t over yet it may still have a happy ending because it ultimately gave microsoft a toehold in the tablet market however all the backpedalling exposes the folly of letting market strategy govern product development pleasing developers and breaking into new markets are important but if they take hold of the process they have a tendency to blur the end goal making products people actually want to use,1

another old white guy is a bad idea for cbs late show,a little background on me in regards to late night talk shows i wrote for the pilot for the pete holmes show previously wrote for midnight with chris hardwick and attended tapings of jimmy kimmel live and conan i also made this hilarious and perfect tweet that was cited by the pinnacle of journalism time magazine opens in a new window wherein i was also adorably mentioned in a sentence along with the word moxie credit besides all that i m the audience cbs wants i m the millennial it and everyone else seems so desperate to ensnare the odds are i don t have the same relationship with late night television that you do if you ve ever stayed up too late to watch johnny carson without your parents knowing or sneakily recorded a david letterman bit on your vcr or always ended your workday next to your partner in bed while watching jay leno ask if you ve seen this or if you ve heard about that i can t pretend to have the same relationship with late night as you i can t and i won t as someone born after i ve always had the luxury of accessibility tivo ing programs and watching them at in the afternoon the next day creating my own custom late night lineups i can shotgun a week s worth of conan on saturday when i m tired and want to catch up on the shows i missed i can then go online and pick and choose the pieces of content that i want to see i can watch clips from late night shows in or from last night s the tonight show starring jimmy fallon it s easy to write off this behavior in me and my peers as add but the truth is we have taste we are picky and we don t have to put up with anything if we don t want to it seems the way executives have chosen to address the problem of my generation is to try and youth anize not proud of that their programs as if we watch a video of a goat screaming because it s on youtube rather than the fact that it s just solid comedy i won t lie some of the old late night formats bore me i don t have the luxury of nostalgia to help me think fondly of them there s a reason why take my wife please opens in a new window and its kazakistan equivalent my wiiiife were only funny the first times or so comedy gets stale but newer flashier gimmicks can feel equally off putting they re jarring and uncomfortable it seems every program wants to be different and shake things up but the truth is that adding a segment on gifs isn t going to cut it all we want is something new and we want something good that s why i m imploring cbs please please don t make the new late show host a white dude don t get me wrong gender or race aren t going to make me tune in every week because of novelty but the chance to hear a different set of opinions tastes and a worldview i m not bombarded with every single day is exciting it makes me want to tune in and there are millions of people who don t identify with white male hosts anymore and crazily enough they also have the internet cbs would be shooting itself in the foot if it pretended they re not there if late night television is supposed to set the tone for our nation s conversation then all we re getting right now is a lot of white noise and it d be nice to change the dial my picks for the next late show host wyatt cenac cenac has already proved himself a capable correspondent on the daily show opens in a new window producing some of my favorite segments for the program but before that he was an accomplished sketch performer and writer as well as a standup comedian his special comedy person aired in may on comedy central cenac also has a calmness and self assuredness about him that could anchor a show hari kondabolu i really enjoy kondabolu opens in a new window s standup he just released his album waiting for but what s notable is how strong and sharp his voice is already with stories like the time a woman cut in front of him at the airport because she thought his father was a cabbie despite not driving you know a cab kondabolu would provide a breath of fresh air to the late night scene cameron esposito a chicago native esposito is a killer standup comic with biting wit but also treats everyone she encounters with respect and candor coming off a tour with anthony jeselnik opens in a new window she recently appeared on the late late show with craig ferguson opens in a new window where the other guest was none other than jay leno keegan michael key half of the duo on comedy central show key and peele key and partner jordan peele set and then raised a whole new bar for television sketch comedy u s president barack obama officially gave it the thumbs up when he appeared on the tonight show in addition to being an amazing sketch writer and performer key is also just as comfortable on stage or in a one on one conversation i ve been lucky enough to talk with him a few times and on each occasion he went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and at ease the best trait we can ask for in a host â although if i m being honest i d happily watch peele host every night too whereas some late night hosts can be boisterous peele always seems to be in control of any situation in the most comforting way possible nicole byer on the more youthful side byer has the ability to hold her own alongside comedy elders her web series pursuit of sexiness which she created with saturday night live cast member sasheer zamata stands out among the pack she s also a breakout star of mtv s girl code plus as an upright citizens brigade opens in a new window alum she s more than comfortable performing live i love jack parr and conan o brien and yes i obviously love david letterman i love a solid format and a comforting presence to end my day with and i think america does too so cbs i m not asking that you reinvent late night in fact please don t just maybe get someone new behind the desk shelby fero is a los angeles based writer and performer whose work can be seen online or on your tv you can

america the winter soldier key details you may have missed,every week mashable presents â œletâ s talk about â â a monday morning look back at the biggest buzziest wtf moments from the weekendâ s most talked about new movies in wide release if you havenâ t seen the film be warned this doesnâ t just contain spoilers â it is spoilers judging by its million domestic opening the biggest april movie of all time many of you caught captain america the winter soldier this weekend but did you really catch everything the film dumped a helicarrier load of new characters fan easter eggs and hints at whatâ s to come as marvel wraps up phase two loosely defined as all the films after the avengers up to and including avengers age of ultron winter soldier laid a lot of foundation for future marvel films just like marvel honcho kevin feige said it would here are the nine winter soldier moments and new characters youâ ll need to keep top of mind while looking forward to next may when the menace of ultron reunites earthâ s mightiest heroes steve rogers is now in charge as it should be what happened â œlooks like youâ re giving the orders now cap â says a broken and battered nick fury after taking advantage of a brutal attack to stage his own death heâ s been revoked of his s h i e l d command because well â the whole organization collapsed under the weight of hydra corruption why itâ s important this is a major turning point in the films but really itâ s just squaring things up with the comic books for years captain america has been the leader of the avengers his role is really more master strategist and infallible human resources department than tactical combatant look for cap to take a major step up when the avengers re assemble scarlet witch and quicksilver are here what happened the winter soldier post credits easter egg gave us a first look at quicksilver aaron taylor johnson and the scarlet witch elizabeth olsen â œthe twins â theyâ re called by their evil captor why itâ s important the scarlet witch has the overarching ability to bend reality with her mind when youâ re dealing with a bad guy as powerful as the malevolent artificial intelligence ultron you need more than just wits and the ability to bash things ultron is so tough that the original movie avengers wouldnâ t have a prayer they need an ally with more cosmic clout we even caught a glimpse of the witch real name wanda maximoff doing battle with ultron in those first leaked set photos above as for quicksilver well â heâ s her brother heâ s just really fast mostly but they kind of go hand in hand stephen strange is lurking somewhere too marvel character doctor steven von strange credit what happened nothing more than a name drop in the second act why itâ s important the sorcerer supreme is like scarlet witch in that his powers go beyond hammering and smashing and blasting heâ s got some mystical interdimensional mojo the avengers are going to need more like him but is he getting his own movie magic ball says concentrate and ask again arnim zola has an out of body experience what happened toby jonesâ character was introduced in the first captain america but as a bit of a throwaway he was the red skullâ s lackey and nothing more in winter soldier we see him more as he is in the comics a worthy standalone adversary who has transferred his intelligence into an artificial shell â in this case a bank of aging computer servers why itâ s important zola is portrayed as hydra loyal but with his bioengineering background and freedom from a physical body hereâ s betting he pops up again and again judging by the nature of his evil plan in winter soldier he might even be the missing link in the creation of ultron himself baron wolfgang von strucker rhymes with â thomas kretschmann who plays wolfgang baron von strucker credit franziska krug what happened in the first post credits scene we see von strucker showing off the same weapon loki used to subdue the earth in the avengers as well as quicksilver and scarlet witch in captivity why itâ s important von strucker is a lesser villain in the marvel universe but they didnâ t hire veteran german actor thomas kretschmann above just to film the post credits easter egg judging solely by what heâ s got in his arsenal hydra leader will be a factor in ultron somehow crossbones brock lumrow is born what happened frank grillo spends winter soldier tracking down cap and trying to subdue him his mission ends in extreme pain but heâ s alive and fans of the comics know the duplicitous s h i e l d agent is the alter ego of crossbones a vile nemesis of steve rogers why itâ s important he may not be in ultron but his presence signifies a potential captain america storyline especially because heâ s aligned with the red skull which brings us to â secretary alexander pierce what happened robert redford plays the u s secretary of state whoâ s really a hydra shill why itâ s important because i thought for the whole movie that heâ s the red skull and i still do the last we saw skull he was being sucked into another plane by the power of the tessaract but he doesnâ t go down that easily heâ ll be back alexander pierce was gunned down at the end of the film and iâ m shocked he didnâ t rip his face off to reveal that evil crimson deathâ s head but hey that could still happen that sharon they were talking about thatâ s sharon carter what happened emily vancamp turned out to be more than just steve rogersâ comely nurse next door neighbor thatâ s what â she was a s h i e l d agent assigned to protect him later we find out her name is really â œsharon â why itâ s important because sharon carter agent was her handle in the movie is steve rogersâ no girlfriend in the comic books and sheâ s awesome sheâ s later turned and unwittingly carries out the assassination of cap could her presence signal a forthcoming movie that will follow the comic booksâ â œdeath of captain americaâ storyline pulp fiction bonus round what happened nick fury met with his scattering s h i e l d operatives around his own gravestone did you catch what the epitaph read â œthe path of the righteous man

line for others the potential to make an impact on a growing business and have a hand in shaping an industry is the main allure with new and promising startups popping up in locations everywhere from silicon valley and new york city to burgeoning tech hubs like boston and miami it s clear that startup culture has its advantages and its hardships throughout the course of our series the first we ve

opens in a new window pinterest opens in a new window credit gabriel trionfi an audacious vision in my experience it s hard to come by leaders who truly prioritize understanding the people they re building for after talking to i was all in itâ s the audaciousness of the companyâ s mission that captured my imagination pinterest is a service that can illuminate the relationships between the worldâ s ideas things and people we can help our pinners enjoy moments of pure discovery new places new ideas things to make things to do and even intimate moments of self discovery i couldnâ t pass up the chance to be a part of a team that realizes that opportunity the transformative power of discovery after studying the developmental importance of imaginary friends in graduate school i worked at ideo opens in a new window and then most recently at facebook on my last project i was the lead researcher on the facebook graph search team where i became obsessed with the transformative power of discovery experiences searching for information is great but people love discovering personally meaningful things even more which is an experience that pinterest delivers the research guy as the first researcher at pinterest it felt good to be the â œresearch guyâ on the creative team but what i really wanted was to bring together a team of researchers that cared most about making pinterest better for pinners we now have a multidisciplinary team of five researchers who deliver end to end strategic insights being one part of an amazing team of career researchers feels so much better than being the lone â œresearch guy â working for the underdog i think what differentiates our culture now is that itâ s incredibly intentional people at pinterest have strong opinions and deliver amazing work even as we grow weâ re a scrappy company where everyone is swiftly getting things done together everything is done for a reason and that makes a difference and this sort of thoughtfulness is true of all teams from engineering to hr and all the rest we still have a ways to go weâ re still an underdog and i like that today pinterest has employees lauren arkema opens in a new window wayfair opens in

mobile offering at the company even as a growing company integral has fostered and encouraged the ability to work in cross functional teamwork outside of my current product group the company has pushed me to reach higher expectations while also giving me the freedom to work in an environment that is conducive to my strengths no seniority complexes the pace at which integral is growing is

new window ajax union llc opens in a new window credit matt yasgar launching a career being new to the new york city job market and really wanting to land a position in online marketing i jumped at the opportunity to get started overall i like the excitement and ownership that comes with being at a small company but your boss or the management team make a huge difference on how the job will turn out i definitely used the interview process to get as much of a feel for the managersâ and ownersâ personalities as they did for me i also knew that structure and roles can be loose so i wanted to make sure they had clear objectives the big break the thing that excited me most about ajax union was that it was my big break in the city i had finally found a job in the industry i wanted to work in since it was a smaller company they were open to taking on employees that might not have the exact resume or qualifications they were looking for on paper they were planning on investing in their employees training and skills to help them grow with the company the yes man within three months i had completed a few training certification courses and said yes to every project given to me learning what i didn t know along the way as a result i was added to one of the agency teams as a contributor on every kind of project they had from social media to technical seo paid search and blogging i decided early on that my goal would be to advance as much as i could in order to gain as much experience as possible and put myself into a challenging and rewarding position in less than a year i found myself in the role of an agency manager and was in charge of my own client list and a small team of specialists a place of learning the culture is fairly loose and entrepreneurial we hold individuals to a high level of accountability and set high expectations to work toward specific goals since the company is a relatively new and small organization it s a great environment for learning something that is promoted at every level of the organization so that we stay on top of industry trends today ajax union llc has employees jason hayward opens in a new window science inc opens in a

marketing style products additionally i have taken a more active role in client pre screening and strategy to make sure that we are focusing our efforts on partnerships with the highest potential high growth impact obviously since we are in a high growth phase there is considerable evolution across many parts of the business but the most impactful to me is the emphasis we are placing on the direct delivery side of the business we have successfully made a few key hires that have taken our delivery capabilities to a whole new level this is easily the strongest cross discipline online marketing team i have ever been a part of on morale and collaboration driven serious intelligent and very innovative itâ s the result of putting a group of very smart and accomplished people in an office that doesnâ t promote the political game that is so damaging to morale and creativity people freely collaborate and donâ t worry about taking credit for a success or assigning blame if things donâ t work out as planned our great morale here is a direct reflection of our management they understand and promote this powerful and often overlooked aspect of office culture today science inc has employees

value add to the business by leveraging people in the organization to reach their full potential at homejoy it was clear i would have the opportunity to cultivate culture and partner with management to accommodate significant growth rapid expansion i was actually an early user of homejoy and a big ambassador of the service there are a lot of reasons why i get excited about homejoy but overall i

only thing scarier than change is i knew iâ d never regret it on teambuilding my excitement about birchbox was twofold first it was a chance to completely revolutionize the way consumers shop and the way brands interact with customers secondly i would be the first person to work on recruiting i was being given the opportunity to build a team and in turn to play a major role in building the company when i came on board full time i was a recruiting team of one with about open jobs to fill i was mainly focused on building an employment brand building a recruitment process training managers on that process and of course finding awesome people to fill those jobs we now have a recruiting team of four people and a people and culture team of seven and growing playing a role in success one of the biggest most impactful evolutions has been international expansion having colleagues around the world changes the way you perceive your customers and your daily work now when i create a program i have to think will this work with the european teams how will we translate this will this scale as we grow another huge evolution has been our customer base â we now have over subscribers and of our

i was offered another opportunity and left the company then in october jamie tedford opens in a new window the founder and ceo of brand networks reached out to me looking to hire a director of

claimed that the website brought in around million in illegal proceeds megaupload wasnâ t a cloud storage service at all it was an unlawful hub for mass distribution â said steven fabrizio senior executive vice president and global general counsel of the motion picture association of america mpaa in a statement on the organization s website on monday the lawsuit filed in the u s district court for the eastern district of virginia lists just about every major motion picture studio in hollywood as plaintiffs including fox disney paramount universal columbia and warner the legal complaint pdf opens in a new window goes into a great detail explaining how in the plaintiffs view megaupload profited from illegally providing access to large amounts of copyrighted work only premium subscribers estimated to be of users could use megaupload for long term file storage reads the legal complaint thus by design megaupload functioned not as a private online storage locker but rather as a hub for uploading and downloading infringing copies of popular movies and television shows including plaintiffs copyrighted works further explaining how megaupload worked to obscure what exactly was on the site the legal complaint even outlines how the site handled its database to conceal the scope of infringement occurring on the megaupload website defendants did not provide users with a searchable index of files available for download from the megaupload website although defendants themselves had access to such an index reads the legal complaint instead defendants relied on numerous third party linking sites to host organize and promote url links to megaupload hosted infringing content including plaintiffs copyrighted works later in the complaint the studios even detail how they believe megaupload encouraged piracy while maintaining the appearance of discouraging it by offering an abuse tool to report copyright infringing files on the site the abuse tool did not actually function in the manner defendants represented reads the legal complaint if the infringing file on defendants servers had more than one url link associated with it which was often the case then in response to a url link reported by a copyright holder through the abuse tool defendants would delete only that particular url link itself and would leave the other links and the infringing file in place on

search crews unlikely to confuse black box pings with whale sounds,the electronic â œpingsâ heard by multiple ships that are hunting for missing malaysian airlines flight which disappeared on march have been described as the â œbest lead yetâ in the complicated investigation however officials have cautioned that the pings which can be picked up by highly sensitive marine listening devices known as hydrophones and more advanced tools called â œpinger locatorsâ may not in fact be from the aircraftâ s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder instead they could be from whales or other marine life officials have said â œfalse alerts may be experienced from biological sources such as whales or interference from shipping noise â the australian joint agency coordination center said on april see also chinese ship detects possible black box signal in search for malaysia airlines plane but how easy is it for search crews to confuse the manmade ping from acoustic beacons attached to the plane s black boxes with the noises of a harmless dolphin or whale this image provided by the joint agency coordination centre on monday april shows a map indicating the locations of search vessels looking for signs of the missing malaysia airlines flight in the southern indian ocean an australian official overseeing the search for the missing malaysia airlines plane said underwater sounds picked up by equipment on an australian navy ship are consistent with transmissions from black box recorders on a plane credit joint agency coordination center scientists who study marine mammals and their underwater noises told mashable that it is â œdifficult to imagineâ that navy analysts who have been trained to recognize marine sounds would confuse the pinger sounds with biological sounds scientists pointed to the fact that there are major differences between the frequencies at which living species generate noises as well as the duration and temporal pattern of their sound pulses compared to those of the acoustic beacons attached to the black boxes referring to the sound frequency duration and pattern catherine berchok a marine acoustics specialist at the federal national marine mammal laboratory opens in a new window in seattle said she would â œassume the aviation black box has a very unique combination of those three things â at the same time she says â œeach marine mammal has a particular way it uses these frequencies â berchok told mashable that marine mammals can vocalize from very low to very high frequencies whereas black box pings are designed to be emitted at a nearly constant frequency of khz such pings arenâ t audible to the human ear which can only detect signals from hz to khz but the pings can be picked up by hydrophones by comparison blue whales berchok said in an interview emit a low frequency sound of about hz whereas dolphins can vocalize at up to khz while some marine mammalsâ do emit sounds within the frequency range of the flight recorders they do so with far different patterns than the black box recorders do berchok says steven brecken a spokesman for honeywell which manufacture both of the recorders opens in a new window that were aboard flight said that a water sensitive acoustic beacon attached to each recorder was designed to emit a signal at a rate of one pulse per second he described the beacons as being about four inches wide and resembling â œa roll of silver dollarsâ bolted to the recorders while the hydrophones listening for the pinging of the black boxes would likely be sensitive enough to detect marine mammal noises scientists said the data would quickly reveal whether such sounds are actually coming from a black box for example blue whales tend to emit their sounds at about seconds at a time repeating this pattern many times over australian defense ship ocean shield is docked at naval base hmas stirling while being fitted with an autonomous underwater vehicle auv and towed pinger locator to aid in the search for missing malaysia airlines flight sunday march credit ap photo rob griffith â œsignals in the khz range would most likely be echolocation and it would be unlikely that an echolocating animal would make just two signals â berchok says of whales that use bursts of sound waves to determine their location and find predators and prey dolphins and other toothed whales emit a rapid series of clicking sounds when they echolocate which allows them to â œseeâ underwater using sound waves much like a submarine uses sonar to navigate the complex geography of the deep oceans according to manuel castellote a scientist at the marine mammal lab dolphin echolocation involves the emission of a broadband signal at ultrasonic frequencies greater than khz sometimes going as high as to khz a ping from the cockpit voice and flight data recorders would not have a signal that departs much from whereas an echolocation click tends to have a much wider range of frequencies within it castellote says â œthese would be very easy to distinguish from a signal at khz by just looking at which frequencies have most of the acoustic energy â he said in an email conversation dolphin clicks and clicks from other toothed whales such as sperm whales donâ t last long when they are echolocating with each click lasting about microseconds such short duration sounds help the mammals hear echoes back with greater accuracy allowing them to orient themselves in the water and find and hunt prey he says â œecholocation signals in all toothed whales is generated in sequences of multiple clicks and the time interval between these clicks is highly variable castellote said a sequence of pings at khz with a constant interval of one second would be extremely easy to distinguish from echolocation by just looking at the temporal distribution of the ping â castellote said brecken of honeywell said it is not known whether the acoustic beacons would change their frequency characteristics as their batteries run out after end of the federally mandated day period as of monday the plane has been missing for days which means the batteries could run out at any time now berchock of the marine mammal

higher than at any time in at least the past years according to readings from monitoring equipment on a mountaintop in hawaii carbon dioxide or is the most important long lived greenhouse gas responsible for manmade global warming and it is building up in the atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal oil and natural gas once emitted a single molecule of carbon dioxide can remain aloft for hundreds of years which means that the effects of today s industrial activities will be felt for the next several centuries if not thousands of years carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as methane warm the planet by absorbing and redirecting outgoing solar radiation that would otherwise escape back into space see also key findings from the new un climate science report in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide briefly hit ppm opens in a new window for the first time in mid may but this year that symbolic threshold has been crossed even earlier this means it is more likely that the annual peak which typically occurs in mid to late may will climb further above ppm for the first time although crossing above ppm is largely a symbolic milestone scientific research indicates that the higher that carbon dioxide concentrations get the more global temperatures will increase resulting in a wide range of damaging effects these impacts will range from global sea level rise to a heightened risk of heat waves severe droughts and floods according to a recently released comprehensive assessment of climate science produced by the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the year history of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations showing the huge spike in the past century the bottom axis is measured in thousands of years credit scripps institution of oceanography modern carbon dioxide monitoring began in on the peak of hawaii s mauna loa volcano which is more than two miles high at that time carbon dioxide concentrations were at just ppm they have risen rapidly and steadily since then both at mauna loa and at other observatories around the world the chart documenting this rise is perhaps the most iconic in all of climate science known as the keeling curve for charles david keeling the scripps institution of oceanography scientist who began and maintained the monitoring program keeling s son ralph is now continuing his father s work although he has encountered funding difficulties opens in a new window in recent months according to the keeling curve website opens in a new window carbon dioxide concentrations spiked to parts per million on april whereas data opens in a new window from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa showed a slightly lower level of parts per million on the same day both data sets indicate that daily carbon dioxide measurements have been at or above ppm since march and the graph appears on course to stay above ppm throughout the rest of the month and into the next â œthe underlying significance of all this is that the rate of carbon dioxide increase is higher than ever at the moment year after year now itâ s been more than ppm per year â said pieter tans a senior scientist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s climate monitoring and diagnostics laboratory in boulder colo â œthe increase is manmade â this is one of the known things about climate change â while studies show conflicting dates opens in a new window for when earth s atmosphere last had carbon dioxide levels this high estimates range from years ago to million years ago these estimates resulted from studies of air bubbles recovered in ice cores from deep within antarctica greenland and other glaciers as well as chemical analyses of coral samples from beneath the sea air bubbles trapped in the ice and chemical clues about atmospheric carbon levels in corals have shown that there is now more carbon dioxide in the air than at any other point in the history of human civilization â œcarbon dioxide is higher now in the atmosphere than it has been for millions of years and the rate of increase has not been seen certainly not in the ice core record going back years tans told mashable this is truly exceptional compared to times when geology or the natural system prevailed â while the earth s atmosphere has seen higher levels of carbon dioxide than it does now as well as higher temperatures and far greater sea levels those instances were due to natural drivers of climate change such as periodic variations in the planet s orbit and in solar energy output scientists have studied and ruled out natural climate drivers as the main cause of global warming since the preindustrial era,1

budgets opens in a new window sure the curriculum guides lesson plans but teaching straight out of a book isn t the way to excite and educate young people great teachers are mission driven they care about each student they go above and beyond they love their jobs and they really need to be appreciated it s not an easy career path but a dedicated and passionate teacher can have an immense impact

pencils of promise she s truly one of the people i admire most max ventilla opens in a new window ceo altschool opens in a new window iâ m lucky to have had many great teachers but kelly wise my senior seminar novel drama teacher of andover stands out above the rest i remember the enormous personal commitment that was implied just by applying to his class everyone knew he required an insane amount of work reading piles of books and plays and watching several movies each week writing trashing and rewriting papers several times in a row he had impossibly high standards but the payoff was well worth it he pushed all of us so far beyond what any of us thought we were capable of achieving however it was the sense of community he built at the same time that stands out the most for me i ll

three days into my tenure as a first grader at farmingville elementary school my parent s received a surprising phone call trip can t read my mother s response and my teacher s reaction to it were both direct we know isn t it your job to teach him months of hard work later my teacher mrs dervin tasked me with the harrowing role of acknowledging a live audience at the conclusion of our class rendition of tikki tikki tembo i was to read from a notecard that mrs dervin had prepared for me but there was a catch i wouldn t be allowed to see the contents of the notecard until that very moment successfully navigating through my lines in front a live audience was a thrill i ll never forget it instilled in me a confidence in my abilities and a love for reading that i fostered throughout my academic career mrs dervin deservingly so was acknowledged in my senior english thesis at princeton which if you look on a map is a long ways away from tikki tikke tembo elliot tomaeno opens in a new window founder astrsk pr opens in a new window like many a high school student i was pretty awkward in my sophomore year of high school i found myself in an ap english class taught by laura fore just about at the same time i decided that being smart and reading old books were not things that cool kids did for my first month in that class i was probably a monster i didn t read anything was disruptive during class and was probably super disrespectful to ms fore but for some reason she kept being super kind and patient with me one day about a month into class she pulled me aside and said i know you don t think lord byron is going to help you here right now i know you might find chaucer irrelevant to your experience here in high school i know wuthering heights can be boring compared to the gossip going around the halls but these authors writings have endured for hundreds of years the rumor on the bathroom stall will be painted over by next week a weak memory by the time you graduate and completely forgotten by the time you enter the workforce you have finite capacity in that brain of yours use it to store and process things of meaning and you live a meaningful life she knew i needed to hear that i was torn between who i was and who i felt like my peers expected me to be her words hit me hard and i started reading again and it was through her class that i discovered my love for writing which probably led me to a career in pr but something in her words struck a deeper chord with me and her approach to a meaningful life has stuck with me she taught me that we have to make choices about what we use our cognitive energy for and that those choices determine the direction of our lives this is something that i doubt will ever fade from my memory unlike the messages on the bathroom stalls which she was totally right about kelsey falter opens in a new window founder and ceo poptip opens in a new window mr charles balkcom was my favorite teacher he demanded nothing short of excellence from my ap english class in high school he was one of the only teachers who bucked the status quo and encouraged students to truly hone their passions mr balkcom wasn t afraid to talk to his classes about controversial topics or encourage independent thinking even before online grading systems provided transparency he stood by providing transparent grading metrics for his class and never made students wait to know their progress on an assignment nobody had any questions about their personal weaknesses or strengths and everyone had a clear understanding of expectations for improvement that level of transparency around academic progress is incredibly important most importantly mr balkcom took pride in his work he never let someone else s textbook guide his course he never took the easy way out his high expectations his transparent and timely grading and his commitment to bringing his absolute best to each lecture or discussion is what made students in class want to do their best in his course mr balkcom was the epitome of what it means to inspire and lead and i will never forget the example that he set for his students credit kelsey falter steve eidelman opens in a new window co founder and head of product whistle opens in a new window mr strouse was the first teacher to show me the value of telling stories as the most effective way of understanding and analyzing a problem rather than simply reciting facts for years i thought school was about memorizing answers and formulas but mr strouse told us really compelling stories sounds simple but in reality most teachers don t approach teaching this way everything we did in class made us feel like we were reenacting a moment he would pace the room waving his hands while his voice vacillated it was intense and i genuinely felt like i was experiencing a moment in time the goal wasn t just to make learning fun it was to empathize with the various people organizations companies and countries involved in whatever event or era we were studying once i got to college i realized how critical empathy was to so many things i studied it made thinking through a problem easier and made writing flow more freely it helped explain the why and made working with others more natural debbie sterling opens in a new window founder goldieblox opens in a new window like most high school students entering college i didn t know what i wanted to study when my math teacher mentioned i might like engineering i looked at her like she was crazy an engineer i thought was certainly some nerdy guy calculating algorithms in front of computer screens all day being an engineer certainly wasn t a path for a creative girl like myself nevertheless her advice stuck with me and i enrolled in mechanical engineering during my first semester at stanford university in less than one class i soon realized my high school math teacher was right along engineering it turns out is an amazing outlet for creativity and innovation without my teacher s encouragement there s a good chance i wouldn t have discovered the wonderful world of stem and all it has to offer credit debbie sterling cyrus massoumi opens in a new window founder and ceo zocdoc opens in a new window i was never a good student until i met mr greco up until the seventh grade it was always tough for me to stay motivated but he inspired me to study hard stay focused and be determined not to fail my desire to make him proud was what drove me to my success in his class and beyond it when people ask me what i attribute my success to today i say it s three things hard work focus and a love of what i do what i don t always mention and i m glad i am able to share now is that i learned those integral lessons early on from my seventh grade teacher mr greco ryan hayward opens in a new window co founder hatch opens in a new window mr laitenberger was the first teacher i had who directly challenged me to be better not just as a student but as a person as my eighth grade social studies teacher he had a ruthless homework lateness policy that resulted in the lowest score i ever received on a report card a he was also the school track coach and at years old i was not the most physically active so he challenged me to join the cross country team and â œlose my baby fat â yes he actually said that i learned from mr l that ability and vision is necessary in the equation but it is ultimately execution that matters you can be perfectly capable of doing something and may have demonstrated past performance but if you don t seize the initiative and continue to work at it you ll just be mediocre or worse never take that next big risk this lesson has stayed with me throughout adulthood and into my career through my five years at google until most recently when i made a life changing move to start a company gaia dempsey opens in a new window co founder and vp of marketing daqri opens in a new window in grade i had a truly fantastic english teacher who over time and with a decent amount of prodding from the class told us his lifeâ s story dharma dass had always been extremely smart and driven growing up and after graduating from college quickly took a job on wall street as a financial analyst making a cushy salary he got married to a very beautiful girl very shortly after graduation and generally felt pretty self satisfied about his â œprogress ticking off the items of lifeâ s checklist however not long into the marriage everything started to unravel the relationship couldnâ t handle the stress of his hour work weeks and the couple didnâ t have the kind of solid foundation thatâ s only possible when two people truly know themselves before flinging themselves into a relationship one day he decided to share some of his lessons learned and explain to us what actually makes a marriage work most people would say that love is the most important component but not dharma dass he considered love to be a prerequisite certainly but not the real crux of the matter where the rubber meets the road instead marriage depends on three things he told us food clothing and shelter first off food if you canâ t agree on what kind of food you like thatâ s a minimum of fights a year right off the bat and itâ s not just about the kind of food but itâ s also about your habits where you like to eat if you prefer cooking or dining out and so on thereâ s no right or wrong answer he said you just have to be on the same page about it when it comes to clothing he asked us how much do you as a person care about fashion would you or your partner member be embarrassed if your counterpart showed up to an event in birkenstocks again it doesnâ t really matter where you fall on the spectrum because itâ s a completely personal choice but if you re too far out of alignment with each other the relationship will suffer from a lot of unnecessary tension and frustration shelter is about the big priorities does one of you want to structure your lives in such a way that you focus a significant amount of time working in order to buy your dream home while the other doesnâ t care if you live in a shack by the river you can see how that wouldn t work the concept that a marriage works best when predicated on the couple wanting the same things in life seems pretty basic to me now but in grade these ideas opened my eyes to a completely new way of thinking about relationships priorities and the big life decisions itâ s one of countless episodes where this teacher made me think and question my assumptions about what i knew as a mentor his contribution to my life was pretty much irreplaceable,1

happened to flight leading theories,one month into the search for malaysia airlines flight and there s still no sign of the boeing investigators are focusing on a handful of scenarios that could have led to the airliner s fate but they admit that we may never know what really transpired in those final hours was the plane hijacked did a crew member deliberately crash the jet is it still out there a few days after the plane s disappearance mashable collected all the possible theories on what happened one month later we ve ruled out a few of them here s the updated list possible it was hijacked by a member of the crew malaysian authorities have ended their investigation into all passengers on board the plane and cleared all of suspicion this now leaves the plane s crew including senior pilot zaharie ahmad shah and his co pilot fariq abdul hamid both of whom are still under investigation police chief khalid abu bakar told reporters opens in a new window that the criminal investigation was now focused on four possible scenarios one of which is a hijacking if it was hijacked though what was the plan that much investigators don t know most hijackings end with a ransom exchange or as we saw on a much more public display of destruction it appears ended in the indian ocean a map of the search area for malaysia airlines flight on april credit australian maritime safety authority it was sabotaged by a member of the crew given reports that the plane s communications transponders were deliberately turned off one after the other investigators believe sabotage is a possibility someone on board seemingly changed the plane s course and deliberately masked its location from radar systems the wall street journal s jon ostrower says opens in a new window turning off the plane s transponder would require disabling a circuit breaker above and behind an overhead panel pilots rarely if ever need to access the circuit breakers which are reserved for maintenance personnel who turned off the transponders investigators don t know but they believe someone with knowledge of a boeing s cockpit was responsible for the deliberate action a crew member had a financial or personal motive to crash the plane the disappearance of the flight may be the result of psychological or personal problems of someone on board said police chief bakar maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money he proposed opens in a new window at a news conference days after the plane vanished if that s the case investigators will likely review who s getting paid what from insurance companies and zero in a suspect from there as the new york times opens in a new window reported on april the payout process has already started the pilot committed suicide though uncommon there have been cases of in flight pilot suicide opens in a new window over the last two decades silkair flight and egyptair flight are the two commonly cited examples of this type of tragedy in both cases investigators concluded that the pilots deliberately caused the crashes a catastrophic event killed passengers and crew subsequently causing the plane to crash since the very beginning of the search authorities have said that whatever happened on board the plane unfolded quickly satellite data showed that the plane flew off radar for up to seven hours meaning that the plane continued traveling until its fuel ran out it s possible that everyone on board was unconscious or dead due to explosive rapid or slow decompression which can occur from any number of instances while traveling in an aircraft one of the more notorious decompression related airplane crashes in recent memory was the learjet crash that killed professional golfer payne stewart in october while investigators never concluded what caused the decompression itself what s certain is that the pilots were rendered incapacitated due to a lack of oxygen in the plane which can occur in minutes if a cabin were to slowly lose pressure the pilots â and their passengers â died of hypoxia a deadly condition caused by low oxygen conditions the plane however continued to fly on autopilot for hours it eventually ran out of fuel and crashed into a field it s possible this happened to malaysia airlines flight especially given the news that the jet s engines continued to send data for four more hours after the last contact conspiracy theories it s at diego garcia u s military base some have speculated that the plane was hijacked and landed at a u s

by soccer kids from countries fight for a field,oakland calif the soccer players at oakland international high school speak languages and come from different countries the beautiful game unites them but they can t play it the way other kids do because their school lacks a key facility a pitch the students who are refugees asylees and recent immigrants from far flung places like iraq afghanistan and nigeria have grown fed up with the skinned knees and missed practices that come with playing on asphalt so they ve banded together in an online grassroots campaign to petition the oakland school board to help them build a proper place to play see also indestructible soccer ball brings sport to kids who need it most with the help of ben gucciardi who leads their soccer without borders opens in a new window program and principal carmelita reyes the students formed a leadership committee built a website opens in a new window and started a change org petition opens in a new window the resulting student led movement for a field is characterized by cooperation across continents and around language barriers yasser a year old student from yemen built the site through wix a cloud based development platform complete with testimonials and photography he and solomon of liberia shot and edited a video for it below which they posted to youtube in an email yasser said he stopped playing on the soccer team when he got hurt badly on the cement which is what inspired him to help his fellow students in their quest for a field of their own with over signatures the oihs petition got the attention of the school board whose members have been meeting individually with the students many of whom come from places where this kind of civic engagement would be far fetched if not impossible even with the cooperation of school officials though the request is complicated the cramped stretch of concrete reserved for soccer is surrounded by a chain link fence separating it from a state of the art baseball field that oihs soccer players are not welcome to use it s part of oakland technical high school another public school nearby and soccer cleats tear up the grass which is expensive to repair a group of enterprising oakland tech parents began to raise the money to build what s now rickey henderson field in when it was just an empty lot at an abandoned middle school the school district then under state administration agreed to let them build the field with the money they d raised which they continue to maintain but in oihs opened as a public school opens in a new window for oakland s immigrant community that relegates the or so students who play together as part of soccer without borders opens in a new window to the concrete lot the students and their parents will meet with stakeholders from oakland tech and school board members on tuesday in an effort to forge a way forward that will benefit both teams both schools and the larger community oakland international students are asking the school board to build a solution that will work for all students it could involve simply putting turf over the small lot they now have or additionally building a retractable fence to make part of the baseball field multi use that has raised eyebrows among baseball boosters and with so much invested on all sides and limited resources there is tension at play the baseball coach recently told a local reporter opens in a new window the students were opportunistic for wanting to stake a claim to the oakland tech field and other reports opens in a new window have largely focused on conflict the baseball field and the soccer lot at oakland international high school side by side credit yasser alwan conflict however is not what defines the oihs team though many of its players have and continue to overcome great hardship ravis a year old from congo who resettled in the u s three years ago talked about the bonds he has formed playing the game it s making me feel like a family here he said one thing that we all have in common is we love each other a group of young women from the team and places like burma nepal somalia and eritrea agreed that playing soccer together helps them learn english other languages and make friends when i first arrived in united states i didn t have any friends and also i didn t speak english gaby an year old from guatemala said before ending the day holding her own at midfield with the boys teams like ravis the girls remarked that they liked the way playing at oakland international brought people from different religions countries and cultures together that they were like a family when it comes to competing interests and space limitations though love and determination may not be enough the oakland tech community understandably has its own petition underway opens in a new window to keep the baseball field in its current configuration jody london the school board member for the district stresses that there is no easy answer iâ m very interested in making sure that we have space for everything but i donâ t know if the site at oakland international can accommodate everything people want it to be she said in an interview though a solution is not clear the students play on when asked why he wanted to help encourage the school board to approve a pitch solomon the student from liberia replied in an email i myself used to be on the soccer team and know how difficult it is to play without a soccer field we move around a lot we sometimes play on concrete which has injured a lot of our players including myself because of the lack of field we sometimes go around trying to find a field to play on and by the time we get it there will be about only minutes left to play this is very discouraging and it feels very bad almost like we re homeless furthermore i know how much soccer means to my fellow mates because from where we come from soccer is everything also it helps our students connect with each other and prevents conflicts given that most of us have only been here for years or less it s hard to communicate at first however soccer creates a new and easier language for all of us to communicate with as for the ultimate goal there remain months of bargaining to be done bureaucracy to be navigated and concessions to be made on all sides but graciela a year old from mexico who s been in the u s for five years says oakland international students have a plan our strategy it s to just stay calm and don t really listen to their negative words she said in an interview it s gonna be hard but the pressure of advocating for herself and her teammates hasn t rattled her i think we re gonna get our soccer field,1

galaxy is the upgrade you can skip,the samsung galaxy is boring while its competitors android flagships such as the htc one and google nexus stake out their territory with a couple of standout features the wants it all bells and whistles however don t necessarily add up to a great experience and samsung pulled out plenty of bells and whistles the smartphone which goes on sale april in the u s on every major wireless carrier is notable for being the first mobile device to offer a heart rate monitor there s also a fingerprint sensor the camera has a new faster kind of autofocus and it s waterproof pretty sweet right it should be however with each supposedly standout feature i couldn t help but think about how they didn t really make the phone stand out that well other phones have most of them by and large with better execution those phones may not have specs that are quite as good but they ve got more flavor at inches the screen on the galaxy is just a bit larger than the galaxy it packs a quad core qualcomm snapdragon processor with of ram the internal storage is but you can supplement that with a microsd card the rear camera snaps images at megapixel resolution and impressively it can capture x footage the front camera is megapixels if setting up yet another smartphone sounds like a nightmare to you you re in luck samsung makes it easy to get started via the smart switch app it even works with iphones by letting you log into your icloud account to gather your contacts calendar and email and if there are android equivalents of your apps it ll download those too designing right the galaxy gets on your good side right away with a design that s simply outstanding at ounces and inches thin its size to mass ratio feels dead on although it s technically wider than the htc one it s easier to hold because it s so light the grooved metallic trim on the outside may look a little retro but as a tactile experience it makes a hell of a difference your fingers will almost always have a sure grip which helps considerably when operating the phone with one hand the plastic backside of the phone which is removable is nothing special although the dotted pattern is a refreshing change from samsung s recent design addiction to faux leather trim the display is incredible i say that with the caveat that the displays on all flagship android phones today are incredible they re all around inches and they all have full hd resolution x colors really pop on the galaxy s super amoled screen although it tends to give whites a slightly bluish tinge unlike many other android manufacturers samsung opts for a home button on its galaxy phone and the follows that pattern it must because it needs the button for one of its marquee features a fingerprint sensor credit mashable will fenstermaker samsung s fingerprint sensor the first time the company has offered the feature on a smartphone is conceptually the same as the one on the iphone you can store multiple fingerprints and their primary purpose is to ease the oft repeated task of unlocking your phone odd times a day potentially saving time and hassle on the iphone this typically works fine since the sensor on the home button has a large enough surface area to catch a decent fingerprint no matter how you press it not so on the galaxy you need to slide your finger downwards over the button to activate it similar to the sensor on the htc one max it sounds comparable but it s night and day i d say the failure rate for my index finger and thumb was greater than the phone was constantly telling me to swipe slower wipe the pad or simply that my digit wasn t a match for the prints stored for my pinky finger the failure rate was more like once you hit five strikes you re shunted to your alternative password which is even harder to enter than a pin camera trouble samsung worked hard on the s camera a good camera is one of the top features people look for in a smartphone and manufacturers walk a fine line put in too many features and users get flummoxed too few and competitors will easily outdo you and there s a great camera on this device but it s sometimes hard to unearth samsung gave the what may be the fastest autofocus in mobile at seconds however you often won t be able to take advantage of it if the light isn t great and you don t tap to focus the phone takes several seconds to actually take the photo negating the autofocus advantage the camera ui has several irritations as well for starters it takes awhile to launch the camera from the lock screen then when you turn the phone to the left to take the shot which i believe is the norm the volume buttons which serve as the physical shutter are on the bottom finally the ui doesn t respond in a way where it s clear you actually took the photo an annoyance of many android cameras credit mashable will fenstermaker if you like photos with bokeh where your subject is in focus while the background is blurred to the extreme you re in luck the galaxy can simulate the effect with a software trick after using it however i found the results lacking the htc one with its duo camera does a much better job creating bokeh although the pics are lower resolution also because the htc creates the effect with a depth sensor it s available on every pic on the you have to choose the feature before you shoot for the s camera samsung pared down the number of smart modes presets for things such as portraits and panoramas with more available for download it s a step in the right direction but misguided the problem wasn t just sheer numbers it s one of overall approach if you take one look at the settings screen in the camera you see it clearly there are more than adjustments you can make all democratically laid out in a grid i expect the usual reaction will be to take one look at it and vow never to return one camera feature that s fantastic with no qualification is the real time hdr mode most smartphone cameras can shoot with hdr high dynamic range which snaps multiple shots of the same scene with varying exposure and combines them however there s no way to know if hdr will actually improve the photo â unless you re using the galaxy with hdr preview engaged you can see what you re getting before you snap much appreciated feature creep samsung thankfully has rolled back its typical bloatware you won t find apps and widgets for the samsung hub pre installed on the galaxy you will however find widgets that serve as gateways to downloading certain samsung apps as well as some apps from their partners and there are still certainly a few pre loaded apps the most notable being s health s health is more than just samsung s bid to get in on the fitness tracking movement i mean it s definitely that but it s not a half assed bid s health which actually debuted in the galaxy serves as a central hub for fitness data communicating with any gear smartwatches you may have even if you don t have a wearable s health can track your steps via the built in pedometer that s of what your jawbone up does right there part of s health is the famed heart rate monitor samsung got lots of attention for being the first to put such a sensor in a smartphone and it should the monitor works very well you need to master the art of pressing firmly yet gently for it to work but having a spot check of your heartbeat anytime you want is nice to have even if the number of situations where you d need it is pretty limited in any case now developers are free to think up some more credit mashable will fenstermaker samsung is in love with a feature borrowed from its tablets called my magazine it s essentially a clone of htc s blinkfeed which is itself a clone of flipboard you swipe to the right from your home screen to see my magazine which is basically a scrollable list of visual updates from various sources you specify mixed with some of your social feeds here once again i find the samsung experience inferior to the htc s my magazine only shows a dozen or so updates before the scroll ends a strange limitation given today s ever scrolling default on most services more disappointing is that the overall mix between news and social updates just seems a little off i hardly ever saw anything worth checking out in my magazine which is strange because flipboard actually makes it if you ve ever had your phone die on you the galaxy s ultra power saving mode will have you breathing a little easier when engaged your phone will only work with calls and text messages and the screen goes black and white a few minutes of battery will last for hours when the phone is in ultra power saving mode it s a great idea i just wish samsung thought to add manually pulled email to the list of communications allowed arguably the best new feature in the galaxy is the download booster when it s turned on the phone is able to use both its wi fi and lte connections to speed up downloading of large files that s potentially very useful for transferring say video files from a cloud service unfortunately the feature needs to be carrier enabled and we weren t able to test it prior to launch we ll examine the s download booster in a future story one thing you ll be reminded of every time you recharge the galaxy is that it s waterproof that s because you ll need to pull off the tiny flap over the microusb port by the way in order to connect the cable the is rated to withstand feet of depth for up to minutes like the ultra power saving mode it s not a feature you ll use much but you ll be glad it s there when you do not the sum of its parts i was surprised that the samsung galaxy disappointed me i found the galaxy note to be an awesome phone with such a clarity of purpose that its productivity focused audience of power users couldn t not love it but the is a different animal with a different customer in mind the mainstream is more fickle and it cares more about intangibles like feel and everyday features like the camera on that score the galaxy doesn t fall on its face but it doesn t excel either let s face it there are a lot of great android phones out there while the is a well performing device and benchmarks opens in a new window courtesy of anandtech confirm this it s hurt by samsung s jack of all trades master of none approach phones such as the nexus and htc one win loyalty by excelling at one or two standout features the galaxy on the other hand tries to power through on sheer quantity of features rather than quality that may work with the galaxy s iii crowd who are looking to upgrade anyway but for the rest of us â well you can try again next year samsung product name the good great design fast autofocus in good light can preview hdr photos in real time waterproof the bad clunky camera ui unreliable fingerprint sensor individual features inferior to those of competitors the bottom line the samsung galaxy is a well performing smartphone but its standout features ultimately don t add up to much,1

gear fit is beautiful inside and out,when samsung announced its ultra sleek gear fit device in february tech journalists heralded the fitness tracker smartwatch hybrid as the wearable we ve been waiting for something that s easy on the eyes in a space filled with clunky products that only sort of hit the mark now that we ve spent some time with the gear fit which goes on sale friday april for we re pleased to say those expectations line up with the real story see also hot fitness gadgets to make you sweat unfortunately the device is only compatible with about galaxy branded devices so you re out of luck for now if you re running ios or have a non samsung smartphone but for those who fall into that group and are eying a fitness wearable this is by far your best option yet there s no denying that the device is beautiful opens in a new window largely thanks to the inch curved super amoled display the first time we ve seen a curved screen on a wrist wearable it makes brilliant colors come to life and sliding your finger over the display feels as smooth as a smartphone s touchscreen using the device is seamless and satisfying although the response isn t perfect the overall experience is light years ahead of competitors such as the nike fuelband se fitbit force and jawbone in terms of both performance and aesthetics in one fell swoop samsung has made them obsolete the gear fit s existence is to encourage you to live an active life walk more exercise often keep track of food intake monitor your heart rate but samsung s overall objective here is to introduce many consumers to fitness wearables for the first time ever you may first come to the device for fitness monitoring but you ll stay for the features typically found in smartwatches this is particularly true when it comes to getting notifications like email and phone call alerts sent directly to your wrist when it s freezing outside or your hands are full it s so much easier to tap your wrist than go digging for your smartphone when a text or call comes in the gear fit doesn t have a camera and it s not running the tizen mobile operating system like samsung s gear smartwatches but it can handle your sweat from workouts and is hypoallergenic too meaning it s far less likely to give you a rash like the recently recalled fitbit band the gear fit excels more in some areas than others but overall it s the sexiest wearable on the market and well worth the extra you have to pay over competitors here s a look at the full picture the right fit the lightweight device weighs just ounce less than half the weight of the samsung gear smartwatch and rests comfortably on the wrists the rubber wristband is noticeably less flimsy than what s found on the fitbit force and softer to the touch than the nike fuelband and jawbone up s band the biggest design win though is the adjustable wristband that lets you select your size by snapping a rubber prong into one of the holes on the strap unlike competitors you can really customize how it feels and not have it sit too tight or too loose the band can also be removed altogether and replaced with different styles another plus that many other wearables don t have too often you re stuck with whatever color the company deems is best and there s little room for personalization users can pick from an assortment of wallpapers and colors credit christina ascani one problem the display nearly overtakes and even spills over tiny wrists those with normal to large sized wrists likely won t have a problem overall the gear fit is much nicer to look at than other wearables which are often rugged and unattractive so this is a good step forward one of the major challenges smartwatches and fitness trackers with displays like the fitbit force face today is comfort related to interacting with the screen when you tap and use the display you have to tilt your wrist toward you and the angle is slightly awkward during testing the gear fit required you to swipe the touchscreen in a horizontal motion samsung says it s adding a vertical option this week so we imagine swiping will only get easier motorola s not yet released smart watch will take on this vertical approach too to work around the landscape swipe i found myself wearing the device sot he display was on the bottom of my wrist because it required less straining getting it ready credit christina ascani the setup process is relatively painless but it s also easy to get tripped up along the way there are two main steps you ll need to take to properly get going first users must access the gear manager on the smartphone to link the device after turning on bluetooth and hitting scan in the manager to look for the device the scan part is easy to miss it took me a good minutes to figure out why the gear fit wasn t automatically locating the hardware once you ve figured that out you ll need to download the s health app where all of your fitness data will live in s health users must sign up for a samsung account and type in username email address to later send notifications to the gear fit and fill out a personal body profile age sex height weight and so on taking it for a ride now on to the fun stuff to turn on or wake up the touchscreen on the device users must hit a small button that sits on top of the display because we re so accustomed to accessing touchscreens these days you ll likely go right for the interface instead of the button and it might take you a few tries to get used to doing so i assume samsung added the button because it didn t want you to accidentally turn on the device every time you tapped that would quickly get annoying especially as you sleep because the built in gyroscope senses your motion the gear fit is programmed to automatically light up every time when you move your wrist every time i first noticed this while out to dinner and was repeatedly disrupted and distracted by my glowing wrist it s possible to turn the setting off from the fit itself something i imagine almost everyone will want to do it s unclear why samsung doesn t make this an opt in feature instead of an opt out but finding that function on the device itself isn t entirely intuitive the software baked into the device itself is easy enough to navigate but there are certainly things samsung could do to make it simpler for example the ui uses checkmarks as prompts to move you along to the next screen except sometimes they re arrows the placement of the checkmark varies depending on the feature too consistency here would cut down on moving along to the wrong screens there s a lot you can do directly from the display without heading over to the s health app like using the find my device feature instead of looking all around the house or office for your smartphone the feature lets you locate your phone instantly via a wailing noise although this is hardly a new feature for smartphones it s cool that you don t need to log into yet another device to use it credit christina ascani personalization plays a big role in the device s software too you can pick different wallpapers to serve as the device s backdrop customize the clock design and of course get a deeper look at your heart rate and fitness levels with the accompanying s health app you can also control the music playing on your phone via the wristband tracker which is especially great for working out or commuting to work although battery life is pretty strong it went a few days without needing a refresh a major downside is that you have to charge the device by snapping on a small accessory and then hooking it into the charging wire that means there are two things you need to carry around with you credit christina ascani during the course of our testing we actually misplaced the accessory and were out of luck fortunately samsung will sell the accessories separately but that s the last thing you want to worry about when adding a new device to your gadget repertoire when traveling or running out the door you might remember to grab your smartphone charger but easily overlook a charging accessory like this samsung does this to keep the gear fit small but we hope future iterations will include a microusb charging port directly within the device s health app credit christina ascani there s a lot you can do directly from the fit itself but the meat of the experience lies within the s health app it lets you set fitness goals monitor your tracking and eventually stay on top of your sleep cycle this feature wasn t available during the test period the health s app is also available for download without the gear fit device but using the two together makes the most out of the experience one of the neatest features of the gear fit is the built in heart rate monitor while it sits on your wrist a sensor opposite the device s face collects your heart rate data and stores it within the app you can also check your heart rate directly via the hardware itself which makes it easy to monitor while out for a run or doing other activities getting this feature to work may take a few shots though you ll have to stand still and make sure the sensor is directly over your wrist credit christina ascani the device itself lets you call out different workout activities running cycling walking and hiking and keeps all of that data in one spot tracking your progression it s important to note however there were instances where the data didn t log correctly and thought i was walking when i was just moving my hands notifications the notifications feature on the gear fit is where samsung hopes to close the gap between fitness wristband tracker and smartwatch and it s in a great position to do so although you can t take calls you can see on your wrist when they pop up and send them directly to voicemail or respond with a quick reply quick reply messages such as i m driving and call back later are pre written but can be personalized up to characters via the app users can also read full emails on the device which may sound unpleasant given the gear fit s small surface area but it s easy to use your finger to scroll down on the touchscreen and see a sentence or two at a time unfortunately you can t flag emails from your wrist to serve as a reminder to go back and respond later notifications work well when a samsung device is nearby but if you re out for a walk and leave the smartphone at home your gear fit suddenly becomes much less powerful you ll still be able to use some of the device s core features such as the pedometer and heart rate monitor but you won t be able to receive call and email alerts overall the samsung gear fit is our best hope for wearables to date it s aesthetically stunning easy to use and is the best fitness tracker on the market and with a sprinkling of smartwatch capabilities it truly offers the best of both worlds samsung gear fit the good beautiful screen seamless experience notifications the bad too many charging components limited to samsung devices angle of screen is slightly awkward the bottom line the samsung gear fit is the best fitness wearable to hit the market and you ll find instant value in the notifications typically only found on a smartwatch,1

s new profiles everything you need to know,the rumors and feature teases are true new twitter profiles are here with a brand new yet oddly familiar look as of april anyone can switch to the new design opens in a new window and it may represent a real turning point like many people who live on twitter i don t look at my own profile page very often i spend most of my time on the twitter com homepage to see tweets from all the accounts i follow and my notifications page to track replies and mentions of my handle i last managed my twitter profile ages ago see also historic tweets that captivated the world however i look at other users profile pages fairly often it s where i learn about who they are through their profile picture and their brief description of themselves which may include details like job location and a link for more information in other words profile pages are important especially for brands celebrities and new users to understand how these new profiles are built and what they mean for your twitter experience we created a new twitter account this is your walk through the changes an old profile next to a new profile credit screenshot yes the new twitter profile does look somewhat like facebook s profile page layout but the overarching theme here appears to be big all the elements on the page are big from the twitter profile picture to the full width header image and of course tweets they get larger depending on their popularity for new accounts though everything is big since all your tweets are equally popular or unpopular since you have no followers or retweets in the beginning despite this apparent pituitary issue the rapid growth of all these elements actually adds more white space to the design making the profile page perhaps somewhat less text heavy and overwhelming for new users getting started step and on building your new twitter profile credit screenshots there s nothing remarkable about the initial setup of the new twitter once you have your user name good luck finding one that isn t already taken twitter walks you through the process of building your timeline profile building is saved for the end in the two screens above twitter is on the left offering me a list of recommended twitter profiles to follow the screen on the right serves up notables grouped by categories like music and sports this is where you find your celebrities some of whom already have the new profile opens in a new window the next screen not shown here encourages you to add people from your email contacts building the new you it s time to add your avatar credit the first step in building your new twitter profile screen is really this one it s where you add the profile picture and description of yourself a couple of interesting notes about this screen you can as before skip it and leave your photo and description blank in the old twitter profile blank profile pics were represented as eggs a nod to i guess your unhatched twitter bird notice that the default avatar is now a silhouette and actually looks remarkably like facebook s no photo avatar twitter s no photo avatar left and a facsimile of facebook s no photo avatar on the right credit composite considering how different the new profile pages are i m surprised twitter isn t offering more guidance on image size shape etc the actual profile pic is much larger than this preview and also in a different spot my guess is that twitter has yet to update the account set up process almost there this is where you add your profile background credit screenshot the next screen introduces you to the new twitter profile page as you can see the profile pic is much larger than in current profiles to complete the profile look though you need to add a header image this is not the same as the background or theme for your entire account twitter still offers a collection of preset themes and the ability to upload your own i suspect though that backgrounds built for the old profiles may not work with this new design to add a profile header image which will take up that blue space behind your profile picture just like on facebook and google you click on the space and upload a photo pixels wide max twitter lets you scale and move it around to position it properly while many twitter users build their existing profile pics and backgrounds to work together creatively they ll have to redo them for the new profiles because the positioning is different new twitter profile with large profile background in place credit screenshot at this point you can see a lot of big changes twitter names handles descriptions links and the pic are all on the far left like facebook however they still stand out because there s nothing below them the menu of tweets following followers favorites and lists are all gone as soon as you post a photo or video that little checkerboard square of media elements will reappear below your profile picture and description if you re visiting someone else s new twitter profile page you ll see the familiar tweet to box for that account who to follow and trends have moved to the lower right i wish twitter would reverse those two boxes trends are far more important than following new people as it is i worry that in their new position those two boxes will be missed altogether both good and bad twitter has a whole new look for the follower list credit twitter s following list is almost unrecognizable instead of an actual list we get a pinterest like board of cards for everyone you re following this allows twitter to add more detail to each account listing profile pic header image description follow link and an other actions menu personally i prefer the simple list this is the new twitter profile edit screen credit screenshot twitter s edit profile screen is also completely new and much much improved from previous versions i defy anyone to get confused here self promotion this is how you pin a tweet credit composite one of the new twitter profile s most exciting features is the ability to pin a tweet now you can click on the little more menu in every tweet those three dots and select pin to your profile page see the image on the above left now everyone will see that tweet first above right it s a smart move by twitter but adding some scheduling capabilities might be wise since i bet people will forget that they ve pinned old tweets to the top of their page the big picture the new twitter profile credit screenshot overall twitter s new profile pages are better looking than their predecessors but the reliance on large pictures and really large fonts is a bit overwhelming big doesn t necessarily mean inviting i think twitter s efforts to make the service more accessible to everyone are laudable but this new look may turn off some twitter pros who prefer their social media lean and mean on the other hand most expert users live not only outside twitter profiles but off of twitter com

washington post journalist melissa bell and former slate writer matt yglesias highlights that the site is meant to serve as a source for information with an ultimate goal of providing context to the news the site s launch is the beginning of our effort to build the vast repository of information that will make it possible for us to explain the news in real time according to the post comparisons to wikipedia s content might be a bit overly simplistic but are flattering when it comes to seo and web traffic the wikimedia foundation which owns wikipedia and several other sites now attracts roughly million visitors per month opens in a new window with billions of page views google s search alone generates of that traffic according to comscore media websites are particularly beholden two areas of the internet social media and search wikipedia may have cornered the market on search but buzzfeed has found success corralling traffic from social media buzzfeed generates about of its

but permanent pages the cards that are routinely updated will provide an important foothold for the site as bell told the times each card will be like a wiki page written by one person with a little attitude obamacare and the missing malaysian airliner are two of the topics covered by the site s inaugural series of cards a quick google trends inquiry highlights just how popular these topics have become on its search engine the searches for obamacare the searches for it will take time to rise through the ranks of search engines but the permanence of the cards is an important advantage links are an important part of search engines as vox builds up its archives and link to its cards and hopes that others do as well those pages will rise up the search rankings it will be difficult to corner the market on an established topic like obamacare which has already generated thousands of articles newer stories may prove easier if vox s card on the malaysian airliner had existed since the plane first went missing a month ago it could have already been referenced many times and risen up the ranks the upside of turning up high on a search ranking for a key term like obamacare is a flood of traffic the downside is that seo has become a very competitive field in which the winners take the bulk of the traffic those who can t make it to the first page of search results see rapidly diminished returns the first result in a search engine gets of the traffic opens in a new window and the drop off after that is steep moving targets weâ ll always be a work in progress vox concludes

ahead a breach in the digital hull isnâ t the internet a grand thing our global village is in constant communication and contact with everyone else we can share it makes the world feel smaller warmer and infinitely more dangerous thanks to those always open pipes your pristine connection to the internet has a chance of being compromised because someone else isnâ t being careful windows xp systems will not be banished from the global village because theyâ re out of date for now thatâ s not a problem but soon the internet will feel like a crowded theater where one third of the patrons are carrying a highly infectious disease come to think of it it already feels that way have you considered how many people you email each day are running antiquated operating systems remember all those netbooks companies sold in opens in a new window they were so successful that it prompted microsoft to finally block oems from being able to bundle windows xp with new systems retail availability ended years before a good number of those netbooks are still running they really canâ t handle much more than windows xp though microsoft has long insisted they can run windows opens in a new window and the bargain hunters who bought these tiny lightweight systems arenâ t likely to shell out the necessary bucks to upgrade anyway do not assume by the way that everyone running windows xp is a tech neophyte or luddite a quick glance at mashableâ s digitally savvy audience shows that are still running windows xp not a huge number but too many by my count big business problems the fact that atms are still running windows xp is terrifying but itâ s only the most highly publicized instance of xpâ s incredible tenacity how many auto mechnaics dry cleaners diners doctor and dentist offices and sub employee small businesses have you walked into that are still running windows xp more than youâ d want to admit iâ m sure they all have their reasons for not switching windows xp just works the interim operating system windows vista was considered by some an unmitigated disaster opens in a new window and worth avoiding by the time windows came along there were just too many windows xp systems in house and too much corporate knowledge baked into the os and the often vertical software that runs on it to switch plus no one wanted to fix what wasnâ t broken perhaps microsoft should have sent out some kind of digital dirty bomb that sabotaged all those xp systems not something that worked instantly mind you but a bug that slowly but surely made it impossible to keep using the os in a way thatâ s what microsoft is doing now without support and protection the windows xp systems will face a relentless stream of cyberattacks that will eventually make all of them unusable but not before it makes them all vulnerable to attack and breach and doubly dangerous to internet citizens which is why i am so scared this devolution of the windows xp ecosystem will be a slow motion fail with potentially catastrophic results system infections will happen in homes businesses and atms at an unprecedented pace even as the world of windows xp users and customers shrinks the threat will grow many people may point the finger of blame at microsoft and when that happens as i am certain it will what will microsoft do will it backtrack will it make deals with individual countries opens in a new window states businesses and school districts to continue offering some kind of support and updates for windows xp or will it hold firm and try to ride out the storm i suspect mostly the latter but the company could end up coming out the other side bloodied and bruised will those recalcitrant windows xp users upgrade forgive and move on will they switch platforms maybe theyâ ll drop desktops and laptops altogether and help accelerate the shift to a post pc world wouldnâ t that be an ironic legacy for windows xp,0

xp isn t safe to use anymore here s what to do next,after almost years microsoft is ending support for windows xp that means that unless you are a major government no further security updates or patches will be available for the operating system despite microsoft s best efforts to convince everyone to upgrade to a newer version of windows windows xp is still running on nearly opens in a new window of all computers connected to the internet that s a lot of computers and users so what can those users do now we ve created a checklist download the latest and final xp update the final patch tuesday microsoft s term for security updates for windows xp was issued on april download the latest security updates this is the last update microsoft will issue some major governments including u s federal agencies will continue to use xp and uk and dutch governments are even paying microsoft opens in a new window to continue support but everyone else is out of luck so download that final update now install and update your anti virus and anti malware tools with market share microsoft knows it can t just cut support completely the company has agreed to provide anti malware updates to microsoft security essentials opens in a new window for windows xp until microsoft security essentials is free but other security options are available including suites from kaspersky and others one note if you ve got an old version of norton or mcafee from that came bundled with your aging laptop uninstall it and install microsoft security essentials or pay for kaspersky an out of date security app is basically like not having any security at all use firefox or chrome if you have to continue using windows xp make sure your web browser is at least being updated your web browser is often the place where most users wind up getting infected with a virus or malware the latest version of internet explorer isn t even available on windows xp if you re still using xp you re probably using ie which is more than two versions old instead move to firefox or google chrome mozilla and google have committed to supporting xp for at least another year prepare or begin your upgrade migration plan if you re still using windows xp it s probably for one of three reasons you have a laptop or desktop from before and xp is what works change is hard and upgrading costs money you have a very specific application that only works with xp such as microsoft money again unless you happen to be a government institution that still uses xp for a very specific reason you need to stop using windows xp i cannot stress this enough it s not just that the operating system is old and that there are security issues it s not just that microsoft has released three successors to xp it s not just that new machines are more powerful have better battery life or power efficiency and are less expensive than ever before it s that windows xp is not safe to use because xp is so old and popular its flaws are better known than most operating systems hackers have targeted windows xp with aplomb for years and that was while microsoft was providing security patch support without that support users are vulnerable so regardless of the reasons you re still using xp start preparing to move to a new operating system right now choose a new operating system credit vernon chan if your existing computer can support windows you can upgrade for but rather than spending on software you might want to look at getting a new computer or laptop microsoft has a bunch of windows machines available on its website with special deals opens in a new window for windows xp users yes windows is different than windows xp and not all of those changes are necessarily positive the good news is that the new windows update available today makes the system more like windows and thus windows xp than ever before assuming you re not using a tablet it includes the ability to basically turn off windows s tile based metro interface entirely and stick with the traditional desktop you re familiar with you may be able to find an older machine that comes with windows unless you can get a great price from an authorized source we d caution against doing this it s time to bite the bullet and move on and if you want to avoid windows altogether you can do that too since windows xp hit the market it s become easier to use an operating system other than windows even for real work although buying a mac is more expensive plenty of users prefer the experience and the software available for apple machines is easily on par with what you can get for windows when mom s windows xp laptop died a few years ago i insisted she get a mac she e never been happier but a mac isn t your only other option linux is far from perfect but it has become much more usable in the last few years thanks to ubuntu and distributions such as linux mint opens in a new window using linux no longer has to be scary there s even a version of linux opens in a new window that looks just like windows xp the best part about linux it s free and it runs on machines both old and new even if your current laptop isn t powerful enough to run windows some version of linux should work on it without a problem that said you ll have to use some alternative apps such as libre office instead of microsoft office and gimp instead of photoshop elements if you want a good place to look at getting started with linux check out the ubuntu manual project opens in a new window most users spend most of their time in a web browser if that s the case you might want to look at a chromebook which is inexpensive and offers a good experience for the web centric user another option might be to get an ipad or android tablet and a bluetooth keyboard a toshiba chromebook credit mashable christina ascani back up and migrate your data moving away from windows xp especially if you ve had a machine for a long time can be hard fortunately a number of services make it easier if you re going to migrate to another windows machine microsoft has teamed up with laplink to allow users to easily migrate their data the pcmover express opens in a new window app is free and will move over personal files user profiles and settings to a windows or later machine pcmover express will not move over applications so make sure you have copies of your installation disks and serial numbers for anything you use day to day transfer and back up your windows xp files credit microsoft if you want to move your apps over too pcmover professional opens in a new window is just for xp users if you re interested in moving to os x apple makes it easy you can either bring your existing computer into the genius bar when you buy your mac at an apple store and get help migrating data over that way or you can use the windows migration assistant opens in a new window apple provides to move windows data to os x again the migration assistant won t bring over apps but it will bring over email contacts calendar files bookmarks system settings photos and music and video files use a virtual machine windows xp running in a virtual machine credit if you absolutely must stick with windows xp maybe there is an app that won t run under windows we highly recommend upgrading your day to day system and only running xp in a virtual machine think of a virtual machine as a computer that exists within a computer it means you can run an entire instance of windows xp on top of another operating system the benefit here is that nothing in the virtual machine can contaminate other apps or files on the main system so if you have to use xp for one specific program consider doing it in a virtual machine using something like virtualbox opens in a new window vmware fusion or parallels desktop the great thing about virtualbox is that it s free and it works with windows linux and os x that means you can upgrade to a new os and still have a virtual copy of your windows xp machine around for times you need to access microsoft money files change is hard but necessary i know that for some users moving away from windows xp is a chore i can understand the resentment over moving away from something that still seems to work it s a testament to the success of xp and the failure of its successor windows vista that the os has lasted this long but change is necessary computers aren t like tv sets or microwaves or refrigerators that are designed to run without updates or maintenance for years maybe someday computers will be like that but today they require updates especially if you want to keep the information stored on them and transmitted between them secure,0

bone conducting headphones are stylish and simple but costly,bone conducting headphones have been around for a while now but a new product from aftershokz opens in a new window offers a sleek design and overall approach that could make the prospect of a bone conducting audio experience even more attractive for the uninitiated the bluez bluetooth headset wirelessly connects to your mobile device allowing you to listen to music and make or hang up phone calls all while keeping your ears open to the natural sounds around you stunning good looks the wraparound device is easily one of the most attractive of its type that i ve seen to date unlike some other behind the neck headphones that seem to scream look at me and my special curvy headphones these are far more conservative and thus usable in any setting no matter what your style or appearance after debuting the first version opens in a new window of the bluez headphones in aftershokz apparently decided to go back to the drawing board and develop a design that consumers of advanced smartphones have become accustomed to from the likes of samsung and htc wearable tech makers would do well to follow the aftershokz s example subtle works best in mobile environments i m looking at you google glass made out of durable black plastic the bluez looks and feels like something that could have come from the frog opens in a new window or apple design studio that is except for one small feature the multi function button the silver button which allows you to start and stop music and hang up phone calls is the only part of the device that deviates from its otherwise beautiful design credit mashable will fenstermaker what they feel like the first thing that came to mind upon first seeing the bluez was geordi la forge s visor from star trek the next generation of course you slide the device around the back of your head instead of in front of your eyes but the design fits just as seamlessly onto the human head and for people with particularly small noggins the package comes with an elastic tension band that will make the device a snug fit for anyone runners and gym rats will also enjoy how the device stays in place even during vigorous workouts as for moisture aftershokz claims the bluez has a sweat resistant design but i didn t put that to the test invisible interface by far my favorite aspect of the bluez is how aftershokz handled its interface on the hardware side the volume buttons charging outlet and power indicator are all discreetly placed on one side of the device s wraparound arms you have to search for them to even know they re there but once you do accessing the controls while wearing the device feels amazingly natural there s also an audio component to the interface when you ve successfully paired the bluez to your mobile device via bluetooth a gentle voice whispers connected into your ear and when the device isn t paired to your mobile device you can check the battery setting by pressing the volume controls if it s fully charged that same voice will say battery high credit mashable what it s good for the fact that there are still so many traditional over the ear headphones on the market is a sign that bone conducting headphones arenâ t for everyone that s true in the case of the bluez as well i found that when playing sounds with heavy bass e g electronic music hip hop the vibrations to my outer ear were just a bit too irritating to continue at anything but the lowest volume speaking of musical genres i noticed significantly more sound leakage when playing hard rock hip hop and electronic music as compared to jazz and classical where i detected almost no sound leakage even at high volumes on its website aftershokz touts its patented leakslayer technology a feature specifically designed to defeat this kind of sound leakage but i was still able to detect sound leakage from the headphones when playing rock music at normal volumes from a distance of just feet away the new york city subway test part of the appeal of these kinds of headphones is their ability to allow you to hear normal sounds while listening to audio from your mobile device but this is a tricky proposition on the new york city subway where the screeching of trains barreling down the tracks often drowned out the sound playing on the bluez no matter how high the audio was turned up so if you happen to be a frequent commuter i d advise you to pay special attention to the amount of noise emitted during your trip on the nyc subway i found the bluez to be mostly unusable credit mashable will fenstermaker shortcomings but just a few sound leakage and only being able to effectively use the device in certain settings are the two main issues with a mostly flawless device but there are other points that some may want to be aware of the battery only lasts six hours with about hours standby time which means you ll need to make sure you keep the usb charging cord with you as often as possible another issue which is really down to design aesthetics is the fact that the device doesn t fold up when not in use i love the design so much that i think the lack of a fold up option is worth the trade off but i did find it difficult to decide where to place the device when i was on the go and needed to take it off briefly at the bluez are a little pricey but overall if you re looking for bone conducting headphones that are beautiful practical and fade into the background the bluez are an easy choice bluez the good beautiful design lightweight feel disappears into the background conveniently located controls the bad sound leakage for loud music only good for certain listening scenarios a bit pricey the bottom line depending on your individual needs the bluez could become your favorite headphones just be sure to consider exactly what you ll be using them for before you buy,0

hashtag opens in a new window tim sullivan opens in a new window placeiq opens in a new window credit tim sullivan culture of collaboration i joined placeiq for the culture of collaboration that comes with an early stage startup prior to my current role i was vice president of integrated and strategic partnerships at at t what really drew me to placeiq were the unique technologies and capabilities that it offers customers at an early stage in this noisy industry placeiq is able to set itself apart from the crowd because of the way it interprets and analyzes mobile data and location it s unlike anything i have seen before which made the opportunity to work here irresistible plugging in the beauty of a startup is that you can plug in and start playing almost immediately startups begin with a certain set of positions in mind but as the company grows those roles tend to change based on the strengths of the company the employees and what s needed to move forward as quickly and as successfully as possible in my case i began as the head of client strategy and quickly discovered that i had an interest in doing much more than that then as the company expanded i had the freedom to pursue those interests that s what is so great about working at a startup things move fast and competition is so employees have the opportunity to bend and twist as needed to make sure the company can break through the noise and do great things the future of analytics i was originally drawn to the company because of its proprietary platform and powerful technology both of which only get better as time goes on one of the great things about placeiq s technology is the extensibility since i started we ve really articulated a vision for our mobile insights that goes much further than say ad delivery we ve reached a point where we can truly say and prove that location is the future of data analytics today placeiq has employees corinne ray opens in a new window vectorform opens in a new

threw me right into the deep end on both of those things and i enjoyed the challenge during my year here iâ ve had the opportunity to design for ios android windows and the web at larger companies my roles might be broken down into separate jobs but at vectorform i enjoy being able to take the product from site map through information architecture and user interface design and then to developers who make sure it looks perfect upon delivery nerf darts and lego the company has a relaxed comfortable atmosphere there are constantly nerf darts flying around the office and we have a healthy love of lego and video games trampoline dodgeball is one of my favorite group activities what i love most about the culture though is the great conversations i have with co workers about design and technology and where the fields are heading we have a group of individuals who are always considering the future of our industry and thinking about what we can do to make ourselves an integral part of it company perks there s a real interest from my bosses in making sure that i care about what i m working on that i m challenged and inspired by that work and that i m generally happy that is something unique even for a small company it s also great that i can spend a week working out of our new york office where my family and a lot of friends are or take a trip to seattle or munich and work from our offices there today vectorform has employees garho kametani opens in a new window baublebar opens in a new window credit garho kametani small vs large startups i already had experience in the startup world so i had no reservations about joining another one i knew what i was getting into at baublebar one of my main reasons for making the transition there was because of the company s small size and my potential to make an impact i was coming from a larger startup with employees where i wasn t able to make the impact i knew i was capable of fish in a vast ocean of rainbows before baublebar i was working at fab com opens in a new window which was a great experience but i was but one colorful fish in a vast ocean of rainbows there what excites me about baublebar is because it s a smaller startup i know i ll be able to make my mark following up on promises one requirement i have when joining a new organization is that they have to have an open supportive and fun company culture i asked this of baublebar during my interview and interviewer after interviewer reassured me that i would work hard and also have fun doing it baublebar followed through on the promise co founders amy jain opens in a new window and daniella yacobovsky opens in a new window set the tone for company they work really hard to keep it fun and grounded today baublebar has more than employees amy dipane cady

came to the fresh diet in a temporary capacity in at the request of a close family friend who s also part owner of the company i had no reservations about a small company in fact i preferred joining one i was years old and my work experience was about as small as the company itself i felt that the fresh diet in its infancy with so much promise mirrored my own career goals evolving with the business my role has evolved substantially over time at tfd i started as a part time customer service representative then tfd was small er which gave me the opportunity to learn and discover all the intimate workings of the company a process that eventually set me up for success my role developed from cs representative to sales representative to assistant director of customer service and now to internal business director the culture at the fresh diet has always been naturally supportive i have never shied away from jumping into a new project or trying to tackle a new challenge even if that meant crossing a boundary the more i became involved the more i found myself fascinated with the idea of becoming more involved with our team down with the doors the culture at tfd is much more than the typical open door policy we quite literally have taken many doors off of their hinges at our office to promote open air teamwork we group desks together and share offices so we can better work together share ideas and start conversations today the fresh diet has more than employees catherine coppinger opens in a new window offerpop opens in a new window credit catherine coppinger ditching the suit i was immediately attracted to the subtle cool factor of the startup atmosphere especially as a means to transition directly out of college into the workforce when i found out i d made the final round of interviews for the business development team at offerpop a recruiter there told me not to wear a suit to my last interview we are a startup silly she said for some reason that really stuck with me not to mention that it lightened the stressful mood though i admit i spent longer than usual deciding what to wear that day when i walked into the office saw the bright orange and yellow walls and was greeted by people who seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs i was hooked not a cold calling job i joined the offerpop team as a business development representative bdr which is a high volume intro to sales role focused on outbound lead generation this might sound like a cold calling job but thatâ s not really true as a bdr you re the face of the company for a prospective client and you re supposed to provide valuable insight and spark enough interest from them to warrant further discussions rapid evolution after i had been an offerpop employee for about three months our company went through internal restructuring that shifted the bdr function to become part of the marketing team we had the ability to hire a number of new bdrs and we also needed someone to focus on building out the team to scale with the rest of the company which is where i stepped in as team lead i began my new role working through metrics on bdr performance using that data to update standard processes for efficiency and consistency and then collaborating on a more targeted on boarding course for new hires to the bdr position i currently manage a team of seven play an active role in the hiring and training of new team members and continue to contribute to outbound outreach efforts keeping things young our office has a very team focused atmosphere and thatâ s especially true of business development which is largely comprised of recent college graduates we all sit within a few feet of each other no cubicles and we keep the day interesting with call offs and other challenges it can get

where client feedback is limited i was excited to be more in touch with our client base at stitch fix each client we ship a fix to leaves feedback on the items they receive which gives us very actionable data on each product reading feedback from our clients always keeps me going sometimes it s hearing about how confident they felt starting their new job how great they looked on a first date or how we got them out of their comfort zone whatever the impact is it never fails to keep me motivated starting scrappy when i started at stitch fix as the assistant buyer for tops my role was pretty scrappy we had a lot to get done every day and not a lot of people to do it my day to day tasks ranged from the traditional work of an assistant buyer to editing product copy and decorating conference rooms as our buying team grows my role has become more focused but it s just as intense as it ever was now i oversee two subclasses within tops and manage some of our new vendors brand

yes yes no dashlane said in a blog post opens in a new window users accounts were not impacted and the master password is safe as it is never transmitted the site does use openssl when syncing data with its servers but dashlane said it has patched the bug issued new ssl certificates and revoked previous ones lastpass yes yes no though lastpass employs openssl we have multiple layers of encryption to protect our users and never have access to those encryption keys users don t need to change their master passwords because they re never sent to the server opens in a new window but

heartbleed is the ultimate web nightmare,it s easy to want to think the reaction to the heartbleed openssl vulnerability is overblown sadly it s not heartbleed is bad it s not hyperbole it s a major problem in fact heartbleed has the potential to be one of the biggest most widespread vulnerabilities in the history of the modern web frustratingly however because the problem is technical very technical it s difficult for regular users to understand why this vulnerability is a big deal what services have been vulnerable in the past and what services remain vulnerable now even worse the technical nature of heartbleed means that as an end user you are limited in how to protect yourself the onus is on the person who manages the web service or who manages the back end service the web service uses not the end user writing about heartbleed security expert bruce schneier says opens in a new window catastrophic is the right word on the scale of to this is an that s about right so why is heartbleed so bad why is this such a big deal geeksplaining openssl at the root of heartbleed is encryption the idea of encryption to make sure the information you send from your computer to someone else or to another web server is protected and secure the larger conversation surrounding the need for encryption has increased since last summer s nsa revelations as an internet using populous we re more aware than ever of the importance of keeping private and confidential information secure think of encryption like a secret language between two people the two of us are the only people that know the language to everyone else what we re saying sounds like gibberish in encryption terms this language works as a set of encryption keys the user that s you has a copy of the encryption keys on their computer and the client that s the web app or server has a set obviously it s super important to keep those keys secure the internet has a set of protocols opens in a new window for handling security commonly referred to as secure sockets layer ssl and its successor transport layer security tls ssl tls is a major part of how the modern web works and like a lot of other web protocols there are various out of the box solutions for providing ssl tls functionality to a website or app the most common implementation is set of open source tools known as openssl openssl is free which is always good and it was designed in such a way that can be used in lots of different types of projects tons of major web services and web apps openssl as a way to provide ssl tls functionality out of the box openssl is included with lots of versions of linux including debian suse red hat and ubuntu two of the most popular projects for acting as web servers apache and nginx use openssl it s not just apps and services that control web pages lots of email services instant messaging clients network routers and even printers can use openssl openssl runs on of the web even if you don t ever see openssl or know what it stands for chances are you interact with it several times a day that interaction can be as simple as entering in a password for an email account or as complex as sending a private message or photo or even filing your taxes why heartbleed is so scary okay so openssl is a major part of the modern internet what would happen if openssl had a flaw what if that flaw meant those secret keys between you and the server were suddenly accessible by someone else what if the flaw meant that someone could secretly gain access to the keys the server has make a copy for themselves and eavesdrop on everything you say to that server what if that flaw was impossible to detect that s heartbleed it s a vulnerability that thus far has operated without detection plus it s designed in such a way that with enough effort and enough time lots of information could be accessed by someone else and you and the server you talk to would have no idea as bad as that is the worst part is that this vulnerability has actually been around since december lots of software packages started using the vulnerable version of openssl in may so for two years any app website bank or private messaging app that uses openssl has been vulnerable to this bug now it s important to note that not every web server or application uses openssl as its ssl tls implementation it s also true that if an app was using something older than openssl circa this bug won t effect it as we ve seen however the vast vast majority of openssl implementations running on the web before monday were running a version vulnerable to heartbleed fixing the problem is not that simple a patch that fixes the heartbleed vulnerability in openssl is already widely available every major linux distribution has issued patches major web and cloud hosts such as heroku cloudflare amazon and others have patched their own servers and fortunately this is an international story the patch itself isn t that difficult to implement but the problem is that along with patching the software some applications need to look at whether or not they need to revoke and reissue various digital certificates a digital certificate is most commonly used by a web browser to validate that a web server is secure the website applies for a certificate with a certification authority ca as away to prove it is who it says it is this certificate shows that website x is connected with a specific name email and dns address which helps prove its identity codenomicon the security firm that along with google s neel mehta discovered heartbleed found that it was able to use the vulnerability to steal the secret keys attached to its own x digital certificates x is an extremely common cryptographic protocol for digital certificates codenomicon s discovery means that it s possible that any certificate issued before the heartbleed vulnerability was patched could still be compromised if someone was able to sneak in an grab a site s digital certificate before the site was patched it could make changes to the certificate or masquerade another site as having a different identity organizations have to make the determination whether to revoke and reissue all certificates via a ca or wait for current certificates to expire it s not trivial to just revoke and reissue a bunch of ssl certificates it takes time with the number of potential certificates that need to be revoked or reissued it could take days or weeks for every ca to catch up for every service if the certificates were issued when the site was still vulnerable there s nothing you can do about the past in the wake of the heartbleed disclosure system administrators have been scurrying to secure their systems revoke certificates check for other patches and change login data what these admins cannot do however is go back in time and prevent any person or organization who may have taken advantage of this vulnerability to access information not intended for them even scarier it s not even clear that it s possible to tell if anyone bypassed the vulnerability in the past in other words patching a system today is great but that can t prevent any silent destruction that has already happened this thing has legs as jason lefkowitz opens in a new window points out the most jarring aspect of this entire bug is that it has lots and lots of potential vectors for instance we all know that at least for a time yahoo mail was vulnerable that means that if you used your yahoo mail password for any other site between dec and now that password also needs to be changed most of us use the same password or a set of passwords rather than using a unique password for every login i m a huge proponent of password managers and i still find myself using the same three or four passwords all too often most of the time its trivial i use a unique password for every email bank and major social media account but discrepancies do happen so not only is every password you ve used at a vulnerable site at risk the bigger problem is that although major vendors and websites are scurrying to fix this problem now smaller apps and sites might take more time or worse they might ignore the problem altogether it s easy to check to see if your email provider or bank has updated its security to protect against heartbleed but what about a local restaurant your doctor s office a company you used once to get a ride to the airport a boutique hotel you booked online directly through their website you might be surprised and scared to realize how many places have your information and how poor their security practices might be what next before rushing into changing all of your passwords it s worth waiting to make sure that each service you use has patched its servers that way you don t have to change things twice other than that heartbleed is just a scary example of what can go wrong when software we all rely on turns out to be unsafe the existence of heartbleed has no big takeaways or lessons for next time this is just a bad situation with no winners and millions of losers bonus what is the heartbleed bug,1

olympic hero oscar pistorius describes killing girlfriend,between sobs and howls south african olympic hero oscar pistorius took the witness stand at his own murder trial on tuesday to finally describe the night he killed his model girlfriend reeva steenkamp last year pistorius account of the events of the wee hours of valentine s day marked his first extended public comments on the killing it was the dramatic high point of a trial that has gripped south africa for over a year and has already included no shortage of macabre startling moments pistorius surged to worldwide fame at the summer olympics after becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete in the both the paralympics and olympics he netted lucrative endorsement deals from nike and others while becoming a global inspiration for overcoming the amputation of both his lower legs to find athletic success then just seven months later he was arrested for steenkamp s killing and charged with premeditated murder by south african prosecutors arguments in his trial began on march of this year and pistorius first took the stand on monday before going into more detail about steenkamp s death on tuesday on tuesday pistorius told judge thokozile masipa who will decide his fate alone because south africa has no jury trials that he struggled to sleep and awoke during the pre dawn hours of valentine s day according to the associated press opens in a new window he said he stepped onto a balcony of a bedroom he shared with steenkamp in his well appointed home in a gated community in pretoria south africa to get some fresh air pistorius said he returned to the dark bedroom then heard a noise come from its bathroom pistorius told masipa and her pretoria courtroom that he felt vulnerable there in the dark walking only on the stumps of his amputated legs fearing a home invasion robbery he said he yelled for steenkamp to call the police then he said he heard a door slam and took that as final proof that his home was being invaded so he fired four shots from a pistol through the locked bathroom door thinking an intruder was inside only later after calling steenkamp s name more and searching for her in possible hiding spots did he realize the mistake he could have made pistorius said he broke down the bathroom door to find steenkamp s bloodied body i sat over reeva and i cried pistorius said according to the ap i don t know how long i was there for so the public has finally heard pistorius account of that night in his own words but the trial s central question still remains is pistorius himself the victim of a tragic misunderstanding living with torment and guilt after accidentally shooting to death the beloved girlfriend he assumed in a panic was a malicious intruder or is that all a lie as the prosecution alleges concocted to conceal the truth that pistorius murdered steenkamp after a lover s quarrel the fallen hero south africa s oscar pistorius celebrates winning gold in the men s meter final at the paralympics saturday sept in london credit kirsty wigglesworth whatever the answer to that question pistorius shocking change of fate has cast the man once exalted as a hero in an ugly new light and his trial offers a window into larger racial and gender based issues south africa has struggled with for decades as pistorius attained fame in south africa after first winning a paralympic gold medal at years old in he was given the nickname blade runner for the high tech prosthetics that let him run he was allowed to compete in the olympics only after winning a drawn out legal battle against the international association of athletic federations and then carried the south african flag at the london games closing ceremony but pistorius was more than just a heartwarming story in his home country for many he was an icon who transcended sports some even found his triumph over enormous adversity to find success on the greatest stage analogous to south africa s journey as a country after decades of apartheid separated black and white citizens simon hartley managing editor of the the south african news site opens in a new window told mashable last month that many saw pistorius in this light because being able to sprint after being born without functional legs is something we need to believe we re able to do if we re going to become a country in which no one ever feels marginalized ever again but if pistorius came to represent the best of south africa his murder trial also magnifies some of its worst the country has one of the world s highest rates of violence against women and many see pistorius killing of steenkamp as a tabloid ready instance of something that s all too common the murder of women by men close to them called intimate femicide is considered a problem unto its own and the very basis of pistorius legal defense is tinged with racial implications in a country just years removed from apartheid and its first democratic election according to some violent home robberies against the affluent are feared by many in south africa pistorius argument that he killed steenkamp by accident while scared for his own safety plays to the worries of many largely white south africans but according to south african novelist margie orford that narrative contains some measure of race based fear mongering pistorius defense orford wrote in the guardian opens in a new window last month inserts a third body into an all too familiar narrative of domestic violence it is the threatening body nameless and faceless of an armed and dangerous black intruder what to expect from a cross examination oscar pistorius weeps as he listens to evidence by a pathologist in court in pretoria south africa monday april credit themba hadebe pool and that brings us back to tuesday s tearful testimony did pistorius shoot steenkamp after mistaking her for an intruder or was something more sinister at play at one point on tuesday pistorius left the courtroom to change from his suit into a shirt and shorts according to courtroom reports then in clothing similar to what he wore the night he killed steenkamp pistorius removed his prosthetic lower legs he stood before the court on his stumps next to the very bullet scarred door through which he shot steenkamp most observers thought this move was designed by pistorius high priced legal team to engender sympathy for how vulnerable pistorius could have felt thinking an intruder was in his bedroom then pistorius told masipa and her full courtroom about how he thought he heard a noise made by an intruder describing that as the moment that everything changed pistorius has wept sobbed retched or vomited in court multiple times since his trial began on march but none of those occasions match the outbursts that came from him on the witness stand tuesday according to courtroom reports different news reports describe his apparently tortured utterances as wails and howls masipa soon ended the day s proceedings with the prosecution having wrapped its case in late march and pistorius now having taken the stand most remaining questions about the trial concern the prosecution s expected cross examination of pistorius that will likely come later this week providing more dramatic courtroom moments the cross examination will give state prosecution a chance to poke holes in pistorius account of valentine s day as well as allow it to continue pointing to evidence it says proves pistorius has a history of fascination with firearms and volatile relationships with women but even if masipa does believe pistorius account of the killing that may not save the man once known as blade runner from a murder conviction according to william booth a cape town south africa attorney who specializes in criminal cases he exceeded the bounds of what he was entitled to in our law and even if he didn t think it was reeva he could still be guilty of murder booth told nbc opens in a new window if convicted of premeditated murder pistorius faces a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole for at least years if found not guilty pistorius could still be found guilty of culpable homicide a charge comparable to manslaughter in the united states that charge could carry a sentence of up to years according to cnn opens in a new window and then there s always the possibility of him escaping prison altogether exactly when that judgement is handed down is unclear but with the bulk of pistorius testimony likely behind us the much anticipated moment of truth marches ever nearer update april a m prosecutor gerrie nel began cross examining pistorius on wednesday accusing the athlete of killing his girlfriend on purpose you made a mistake he told pistorius trying to rattle him according to cnn opens in a new window you shot and killed her say it i shot and killed reeva steenkamp nel whom the new york times opens in a new window describes as combative dogged and pugnacious he s known as the pit bull even took out a graphic picture of steenkamp s head after the shooting pushing pistorius to look at it take responsibility for what youâ ve done he said according to the times pistorius refused saying he remembered that image i was there he said adding that the memory tormented him at that point pistorius started weeping and the court took a recess to give him time to compose himself the paralympic athlete defended himself saying he did not intend to kill steenkamp or anybody else for that matter i had a fear i didn t have time to think i discharged my firearm he said i didn t intend to shoot at anyone i shot out of fear the court was adjourned for the day bonus stunning sports photos from,1

why pulling messenger from facebook mobile is a terrible idea,facebook is making what could be its dumbest decision ever itâ s pulling chat out of the core facebook app and forcing mobile users who want to chat to install its facebook messenger app this is a terrible idea here facebook are my top reasons why i don t need another app i already have way too many installed and recently did some app spring cleaning to sort out the mess if i add facebook messenger iâ m unlikely to use it often enough to want to keep it facebook messenger is sub par no one iâ ve spoken to likes the app to be fair it does have a lot of positive reviews on itunes opens in a new window so maybe i m just talking to the wrong people but i still don t want it facebook in the few months following the launch of messenger the number of people using messenger grew more than and we ve seen a large increase in the number of messages sent if i wanted to use facebook messenger i would have installed it since iâ ve been a facebook member for years and have been using the built in chat for almost as long you can assume that i like it the way it is thank you very much this will actually hurt facebook if you insist on pulling chat out of facebook mobile you will also suck the real time nature out of the social platform for millions of users you canâ t force people to install facebook messenger so they may simply leave to find another platform with better real time communications features is this why you bought whatsapp facebook messenger was rebuilt from the ground up to be an instant mobile to mobile communications platform for people who want to be reachable at all times we ve found that people get replies faster on messenger than on facebook you didn t ask first your own page on facebook has million likes thatâ s a lot of engaged reach why didnâ t you ask some of the people who like you what they thought of this idea were you afraid they would say â œhell no â making this kind of radical change will leave a bad taste in usersâ mouths remember they canâ t stand when you change things i know youâ ve only just become a â œmobile firstâ company but expect this to hurt you on that front as well facebook we have tested this in a handful of countries for the last several months and found that people enjoy the messenger experience itâ s faster than messaging in the core app and messenger has features that arenâ t available in the core app like the groups tab weâ re also testing a new composer that includes a selfie cam and more ways to express yourself since i can t run two apps on one screen in iphone this is the worst idea ever seriously i assume you want me running both the facebook app and messenger at the same time the iphone can multi task but for in facebook communication iâ d want both apps on screen i really want one app what do i do now facebook messages are already disabled from the core app for people who have messenger and facebook installed linking between the two apps is quick and easy i love chatheads donâ t take them out of facebook of all the things that came out of facebook home chatheads is the one winning idea i love having the little heads pop up on my screen when itâ s time to chat being able to drag and drop them and even being able to deep six them when iâ m done why would you take such a smart feature out of facebook facebook chat heads arenâ t going anywhere on android in fact people who download messenger on android gain chat heads because they were not a feature in the core android app the android platform enables chat heads to sit on top of any application this isnâ t possible on ios and chats heads were built in the main ios app because it was a quick and fun way to access your messages switching apps will only increase annoyance i assume that the little green button the one that indicates someone is live on facebook will remain but now when i tap it in facebook a second app will load iâ ll be constantly switching back and forth likely cursing facebook the whole time facebook tapping â œreturn to facebookâ from messenger takes you right back to where you left off in the facebook app just like tapping on news feed from your messages tab if you donâ t have messenger installed worst idea since facebook paper or home donâ t take this the wrong way facebook but your home grown app business is shaping up to be a huge fail havenâ t you noticed how when you buy it flies instagram and when you build it fails home messenger is at least familiar inside facebook but it really needs the whole environment around it to truly fly donâ t clip its wings facebook since relaunching messenger in october weâ ve seen an increase in usage by mark mentioned this on our last earnings call one of your biggest user bases moms and dads will hate you teens donâ t care because an increasing number of them are chatting elsewhere see whatsapp â above â and snapchat but parents live on your platform many of them are accessing facebook through their ipad if you take messenger out of there you will have a revolt on your hands and as soon as parents figure out how to complain â œis there a â contact usâ somewhere on this site â they will facebook this is only for the ios and android experience and does not apply to ipad twitter will thank you for this huge f mess up twitter is not much of a real time chat tool but the company did just introduce something just like that under its quirky vine six second creation tool sure not a lot of regular people use vine but maybe twitter will now consider embedding the whole service inside twitter mobile just to make you look silly,0

ditching windows xp will make the whole internet safer,support for windows xp may be over but the year old operating system isn t going anywhere certainly there will be a rush to upgrade older systems after microsoft kicked xp to the curb on tuesday but looking at simple numbers more than opens in a new window of all computers worldwide still run the software holdouts are inevitable that poses a growing danger not just to those pcs but to any system coming into contact with them with significant market share and no more official support windows xp will become a prime target for malware creators with xp microsoft began a kind of tradition knowns as patch tuesday every month the company would push out updates to to the various versions of windows to fix bugs and close holes that could compromise system security starting in may windows xp won t be included in those updates xp shipped in explains tom murphy director of communications for microsoft windows that means the engineering and design work went on in the late from a security perspective xp inherently isn t designed to protect you from the kinds of threats we see online today the evolution of windows security windows for example tightened access to key system files even from system administrators windows and later took things even further with extensive sandboxing of apps restricting how much data they can share but xp is a much less controlled environment and since its just one in a long line of windows versions the problem is even worse it s not like holes are going to stop being discovered says gerry egan senior director of product management at symantec even worse holes will continue to be discovered across newer oses that are relevant to older oses but these vulnerabilities being disclosed will provide a road map in many ways for attackers that puts more of a burden on security companies to pick up where microsoft left off they re more than happy to do so since all those xp machines still out there will need to double down on malware protection it s probably our biggest opportunity says gary kovacs ceo of avg which provides freemium antivirus software people are just not in a hurry to upgrade antivirus becomes something they subscribe to to take care of the stuff that used to be in xp since it s no longer supported we re seeing an uptick in downloads even though most security companies won t be ending support for the xp versions of their software they still want you to upgrade as time goes on xp machines will become less and less secure as holes crop up while upgrading malware protection will help it s an inherently less effective solution imagine i discover a broken window latch in my house explains egan i may have a home security system with motion detectors that will set off an alarm if anyone jumps in and i can call the police but the best fix is to fix the latch in the first place if a malware creator wants to take advantage of a security hole it s easier than ever to do so people intent on distributing malicious software sometimes don t even need extensive knowledge of coding or app development now you see malware as a service where they re buying modules says kovacs so if i want to hijack machines for clickfraud i dont even have to develop the malware anymore how to flee a dying os many large businesses haven t upgraded from windows xp for many reasons mainly cost usability and compatibility with custom software the majority of atms for example still run some version of xp for those organizations that are reluctant to upgrade microsoft put in some tools in the latest windows update that will improve compatibility with older custom software and for large scale upgrades that will take time microsoft will actually support certain enterprise versions of xp past the expiration date many large companies have a complex migration process says murphy with larger customers we will provide temporary support for xp machines that are in the process of being migrated it s a temporary measure the path of last resort consumers and small businesses don t have that option of course and microsoft is doing everything it can to convince them to upgrade the company provides extensive online guides opens in a new window for upgrading to a newer system tools for copying files and settings opens in a new window and even a dirt simple site amirunningxp com opens in a new window for those who may actually be unsure what their os is for those who insist on sticking with xp security vendors will support it for the foreseeable future the risk of infection however will increase over time potentially threatening other systems while skeptics might question microsoft s decision to end xp support with such a significant slice of the market still running the os it s done and future windows patches will provide malicious parties all the data they need to infect those older systems the message couldn t be clearer for the good of your data and everyone else s ditch windows xp as soon as you can,1

topics every email marketer should understand,some years ago ok many years ago i joined a custom publishing agency my first week was one of deep orientation during that week i was taken through the details of the publishing process i was taught about the print process the different types of printers paper and printing techniques color processes cmyk and spot color collation distribution and the postal system i was taught about copy writing editing layout and proofing and all the other steps that go into creating the final product in short i got a five day backgrounder on how the underlying technologies and processes of the industry worked and how they impacted our work what i ve come to realize is that in today s digital marketing world it s very rare that an email marketer gets this kind of background and i don t mean in print i mean in email i commonly come across email marketers who don t know how the channel that is the basis of our livelihood works here then are my top five things that every email marketer should know how email is delivered i believe every email marketer should know how this works how their message actually gets delivered from the basics of mail servers and dns through to the smtp simple mail transport protocol transport and delivery of email it may seem technical and irrelevant to marketers but this is important knowledge because it has a significant impact in a wide range of areas spam filtering depends on and impacts this process to understand blocking and filtering the difference between an rbl and a uribl means understanding this process to understand what bounce codes and responses mean and how they impact your delivery requires understanding of this process how email is displayed html hypertext markup language is the language of email the html dialect for email is different to that for websites the capabilities and limitations in regards to email are important and becoming more so the growth of mobile and adoption of mobile first and responsive designs change how our messages look and why every email marketer should understand what can and can t be done what should and should not be done why content displays differently on different platforms and how responsive design works basic statistics email is a data driven medium unfortunately all too often email marketers come from non mathematical backgrounds and never learned these basics we receive a deluge of data about our programs and campaigns what often surprises me though is how little that data gets used top line metrics such as delivery open and click rates are compared month on month but often there s little more than that simply knowing what makes a test good and a result statistically significant is invaluable effective use of the available data can make the difference between a good program and a great one privacy and security as i wrote back in february opens in a new window email marketers are handling a growing quantity of data and increasingly make essential decisions about collection storage transfer and use of that data every email marketer needs to be up on both privacy and security and how it impacts what we do every single day there is often a significant disconnect between the policy and the practice of data privacy and security understanding the fundamentals the whys and wherefores removes that disconnect and enables email marketers to make smart decisions even when the privacy group is not around direct marketing fundamentals email marketers come from a range of backgrounds and email is such an effective channel that it seems oftentimes we can get away with ignoring marketing fundamentals and still get great return on investment roi but even though it s a unique channel email marketing is still direct marketing and the fundamentals are important the four ps of product price place and promotion and the three ms of market message and medium are still very relevant foundations to effective marketing in the age of the fragmented customer journey the mobile consumer and cross channel messaging i want to be clear that i m not saying email marketers should know how to write a mail server be html coding wizards or ph d statisticians we are doing data driven marketing with email and an understanding of the fundamental aspects of data marketing and email are important without these fundamentals we re in no position to have serious discussions about the subtleties and nuances of email strategies and tactics instead we ll be continually rehashing the same conversations and readdressing the same misconceptions so that s my list what s yours what would you add to or remove from the list of things every email marketer should know,1

and days with a connected breathalyzer,in a movie theater the feature film was just about to start and my minutes was up i pulled out my iphone and plugged a small black device into the headphone jack tilting my phone s bright screen to the ground so i wouldn t distract the other moviegoers slowly i blew into the device for a few seconds until my phone vibrated then i checked the result a blood alcohol concentration of i was using alcohoot a breathalyzer that connects to your smartphone the device was released last fall and it isn t alone another connected breathalyzer floome is scheduled to go on sale this year and was featured in proto labs cool idea awards opens in a new window these are consumer devices but it s not clear if the purpose is entertainment or safety on the regulatory side ignition interlock devices opens in a new window in cars have been around since the and prevent a person convicted of a dui from starting the car if he or she has been drinking beyond compulsory use measuring one s own bac on a night out or even a night in could be part of the quantified self movement it just isn t as sexy as a wristband that measures steps or sweat such as nike fuel after experimenting with alcohoot over the past month with different drinks i discovered the device was far from a party foul perhaps it s novelty but pulling a connected breathalyzer out of my purse at a group dinner was the equivalent of dropping some juicy gossip others begged to try it out themselves the downside the data just isn t actionable it s a resounding critique we ve come to expect in the activity tracker market and the quantified self movement in general the nuances in logging a reliable bac are serious enough that you may not want to depend on a personal device to make decisions about driving thus the personal connected breathalyzer seems to go the way of many other quantified self devices it s a great tool for personal enlightenment the headphone plug on alcohoot is retractable so it can fit comfortably inside a pocket credit alcohoot recommends you wait minutes after your last drink before measuring a handy timer is one feature of its app but it s possible your bac will continue to rise for minutes to an hour after your last drink depending what you ve had to eat and how much time you spend drinking this is why rising blood alcohol opens in a new window can be used as a defense in drunk driving cases the alcohoot app which logs your bac every time you blow can help call an uber or find a nearby restaurant at which to sober up if you re over your country s legal limit opens in a new window in the u s it recommends not driving for fear of a ticket or worse after using alcohoot on drinks over separate days i now have a much better idea how each type of drink affects me i was surprised to find a craft ipa was not much more potent than a cheap beer and that food really does make a difference i could feel a buzz after a mimosa with brunch but still clocked in at bac of course every person metabolizes alcohol differently so take the examples below with caution case in point at dinner with a friend my two glasses of vespa bianco got me to while his two glasses of prosecco equaled in these examples i generally ate a meal prior to drinking and i travel by subway in nyc so driving after drinking was never an issue you can buy alcohoot on the company s website for opens in a new window it s compatible with ios and android mimosa bac i went to brunch in brooklyn with a friend and ate a bowl of house made tater tots covered in scrambled eggs cheese and guacamole along with my second cup of coffee of the day the mimosa was delicious and i don t doubt it contained real champagne but alas bac a brunch mimosa from a brooklyln diner credit danifankhauser mojito bac when i signed up for a group date with the dating ring i knew it would be a good excuse to splurge on a fun cocktail instead of my usual glass of wine i d initially planned to check my bac on my way home i thought it would be awkward to pull out alcohoot at the table among strangers when the group decided to go for a second drink i realized i needed to blow right away to measure only the first drink as it turned out one person on the date insisted everyone at the table also measure his bac only one person refused perhaps inconsequentially the two eventually left the bar hand in hand a mojito from a bar on manhattan s les credit danifankhauser cheap beer bac it was a weeknight and i decided to continue my drinking journey on a night in while catching up with portlandia on netflix the convenience store near my apartment has a decent selection of beer including the kind i would never drink by choice but i was curious if the type of beer would correspond at all with the eventual bac a can of big flats opens in a new window which has abv was only bac below a cup of two hearted ipa opens in a new window which has abv two cans of big flats got me to bac still lower than a single glass of wine the cheapest beer i could find at my local convenience store was big flats a six pack for less than credit danifankhauser craft beer bac i went to a party held at whole foods in store pub on tap to celebrate susty party s latest product line biodegradable cup pictured the highly rated two hearted ipa opens in a new window was well on tap while drinking i also munched on some locally sourced cookies ice cream and an appetizer portioned hot dog craft beer served at whole foods in the bar credit danifankhauser whiskey bac i m just beginning to develop a taste for whiskey as a standalone beverage but haven t quite gotten the hang of ordering it yet after i left a dry event i decided to stop by a whiskey bar down the street from where i live around p m to do some reading on my kindle it was busy for a weeknight but i found some free seating around the perimeter i asked the bartender for a good whiskey for beginners he gave me glen grant on the rocks which was indeed smooth and not at all intimidating glengrant on the rocks credit danifankhauser margarita bac testing a connected breathalyzer is a good excuse to explore one s own neighborhood so when i went looking for a margarita i found a mexican food restaurant a few blocks away in my experience margaritas can vary in both size and strength this one tasted decent in terms of strength but was on the smaller end actually it was half the size of the margaritas i used to get for taco tuesday when i lived in san diego i browsed articles on pocket and read twitter while i drank then set alcohoot s minute timer when i paid and left a mid sized margarita from a mexican food restaurant credit danifankhauser rioja bac when you get a glass of wine at a wine bar you re usually guaranteed a good pour and that was definitely the case here the glass itself was still large enough to allow for proper oxidation of the tempranillo blend from rioja spain along with the wine i shared a pizza with my okcupid date who wasn t drinking despite having agreed to meet at a wine bar a spanish red from an italian wine bar credit danifankhauser champagne bac a coworker and i went searching for an after work drink venue and landed at the corner of the bar in an american food restaurant my champagne was served in the standard flute very unlike red wine s wide goblet so it can be hard to compare by size to add the rumors that champagne s bubbles increase its abv have gotten mixed scientific reviews opens in a new window but at least in my experience champagne seems to make a bigger impression than regular wine a glass of champagne from a downtown manhattan bar credit danifankhauser jack rose bac the only drink poured by a non professional in this anecdotal study came at an office happy hour the jack rose contains applejack grenadine and lemon or lime juice it was popular in the and while i m told this one isn t popularly served in bars any longer it could make a unique offering at a house party the classic cocktail jack rose credit danifankhauser shot and beer bac despite my desire to compare single drinks individually i didn t feel right ordering a shot by itself so when i was on my way to a film screening i found a bar with decent happy hour prices and got myself a shot of cuervo along with sam adams cherry wheat despite the bartender s recommendation against it i found it quite tasty,1

carbon steel edition a wearable that s actually wearable,in the last year alone the question has shifted from whether weâ ll be wearing wearables in the near future to which one is our favorite and what we want to try next in fact thanks to the proliferation of fitness trackers from the likes of jawbone and fitbit it s only a matter of time before we start mentioning sleep and heart rate information in casual conversation so for the sake of introductions my name is brian i got two hours of rem sleep the other night and my standing heart rate is i can also give you some information on how much i sweat how many times i woke up in the middle of the night and precisely how warm my skin gets when iâ m riding my bike to the grocery store but then what would we talk about on our second date see also fitness trackers that make a run at recording heart rate one of the early adopters in the fitness tracking space is basis with its original band introduced in late the product earned a name for itself for the thoroughness of the data it collects not only does it track footsteps and calories the fitness watch gathers an impressive level of detail about whatâ s going on with your body when youâ re sitting walking running biking and sleeping and that information has only grown in detail through subsequent software updates back view of the basis carbon steel edition credit brian heater mashable in january the company announced more updates to the watchâ s capabilities mostly pertaining to how well it watches you sleep along with those upgrades came a fancy new version of the watch the basis carbon steel edition opens in a new window which like the recently refreshed pebble smartwatch takes a moment to focus on aesthetic and wearability â elements that werenâ t really given enough love in the first go round with that in mind letâ s kick this off by talking looks wearability above all weâ re still in the relatively early days of the wearable explosion and making wearables that are actually you know wear able hasnâ t really been a primary focus of a lot of manufacturers look at samsungâ s first generation galaxy gear in its rush to build the smartwatchâ s brains samsung seemingly forgot that it was building a watch the original basis band had similar issues and the company fielded a lot of concerns from users about bulk and discomfort â both things that should be a chief concern when building a piece of hardware youâ re meant to wear all day and all night full disclosure i honestly canâ t remember the last time i wore a watch with any regularity like many out there my obsessive compulsive need to check the time has been almost exclusively addressed by the phone iâ ve got in my pockets at all time so when i first unboxed the basis i was a bit taken aback by the size of the thing true the company has gone a ways toward making the product more comfortable slimming its profile a bit and making a much more flexible wristband but the wearable is still considerably larger than the dumb watches most of us are used to wearing think about those old casio g shocks and youâ re in the right ballpark it fits pretty comfortably though once you actually get it on granted the strap still could be a bit more flexible but thatâ ll likely come with wear and tear after wearing it for a few hours however i found myself having to take it off to give my wrist a rest â though thatâ s a perfect opportunity to charge the watch up seeing as how youâ re going to be wearing the thing to sleep speaking of which it may as well had been the first time iâ ve intentionally worn a watch to sleep but in spite of the deviceâ s size it wasnâ t too awkward an experience â it certainly beats slipping on one of those zeo tracker headbands it also does a pretty good job of knowing exactly when youâ re boarding that express train to slumberland as for the look of the device basis still has a ways to go before one can in good conscience call the product â œstylish â the face of the watch hasnâ t changed much the monochrome display is a diminutive millimeters making it tough to check when youâ re running â though maybe itâ s best to focus on running when youâ re running as with the the face is mostly bezel â this is due in part that basis opted to utilize a four touch pin near the corners of the display rather than including a touchscreen the result is a lot of toggling thatâ ll bring you back to the pre smartwatch days checking your heart rate for instance requires you to tap one of the pins on the right side five times the button on the upper left turns the backlighting on and off while the one on the bottom left switches between the date and time on the right side of the watch is a single thin menu button tap that and use the pin to sync the device and toggle through bluetooth settings there are four pins on the other side for charging which requires you to slip the watch into a somewhat flimsy plastic cradle on the back is a small eye that glows green when in use this is surrounded by six more metal points all of these rest against your skin when in use collecting information on your heart beat blood floor skin temperature and sweat output did we mention that the device is thankfully water resistant i got some comments from folks i know while wearing it out itâ s not flashy by any stretch but itâ s hard to miss no one found it particularly objectionable but many asked what it did before i even had a chance to say anything which is to say itâ s pretty clear that the basis isn t just a regular old digital wristwatch at first glance what the watch watches after wearing the basis around i have to say iâ m pretty impressed by what it knows about me youâ ll only get the basics on the watchâ s display â which is not surprising given the limited real estate there toggling through you can find out the amount of calories youâ re burning your current heart rate and the distance youâ ve run biked and walked during the day and indeed the watch does a good job distinguishing all of those activities a look at the data credit if you want more information youâ ll need to sync it to your android or ios device the free app has a simple clean layout breaking up the amount of time youâ ve performed each activity along with the specific times of day tap into one of those and you can get a more detailed break down of how many calories while exercising and how you slept last night the latter is particularly interesting letting you know what percentage of your sleep was light deep and rem and how many times you tossed and turned and woke up altogether apparently i had toss turns and got up twice clearly i was too excited to review the basis to actually sleep the app also offers habits â small goals in pursuit of bettering yourself from running and walking more to getting more sleep time â œdonâ t be a sitterâ seemed as good a first goal as any â like most of you desk jockeys out there i could stand to stand a bit more between and on weekdays you can set the specific amounts of time and the app will let you know how youâ re doing on a daily basis and once youâ ve unlocked that goal the app lets you set others when you need even more information you can log into basis web portal here things get super super detailed ever wanted to know say just how sweaty you get while biking honestly i canâ t say i ever have but it could perhaps be good information to share with your doctor though as the company warns on its site the watch isnâ t intended to be a replacement for actual medical monitoring equipment what to wear in the time iâ ve spent wearing it i canâ t honestly say iâ ve forgotten that iâ ve had the watch on but the update to the device does make it much easier to wear and thatâ s well worth the extra this device runs over its recently discounted predecessor at the carbon steel edition falls somewhere between the fitbit flex and the pebble steel itâ s also somewhere between the two in terms of functionality you canâ t really call it a smartwatch seeing as how you wonâ t be checking your driving directions or email messages but the small display does bring functionality lacking in fitness bands letting you check the time hence the â œwatchâ part and monitor your activity in real time well with a delay of a few seconds the latter is great for those who need to micromanage such things and may serve to push yourself harder as you attempt to hit those fitness goals and thatâ s really the whole point here giving users the motivation they need to live a more active lifestyle if youâ re looking for something thatâ ll help you track that information while remaining mostly out of the way jawbone and fitbit offer much more indiscreet solutions what basis does offer however is a constant motivation to keep pushing yourself basis carbon steel edition the good in depth sleep tracking slicker than its predecessor habits feature helps you push yourself the

signing climate statement shell charts different course on global warming,faced with ominous scientific warnings on global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas two energy giants exxon mobil corp and royal dutch shell have sent diametrically opposing signals in recent weeks exxon for its part told its shareholders on march that the company does not think that policies to address manmade global warming constitute a risk to the companyâ s profitability because global policy makers are not going to enact strict emissions limits before instead the company plans to exploit all of its remaining oil and gas reserves as well as new discoveries through see also carbon dioxide levels climb into uncharted territory for humans if this turns out to be the case it would be a boon for exxon but a potentially disastrous scenario for the climate based on the most recent scientific data showing that dramatic cuts in greenhouse gases are needed in the near term to prevent the most dangerous global warming related impacts such as the collapse of land based ice sheets in greenland and parts of antarctica shell on the other hand decided to join more than other companies including adidas and unilever by signing onto a non binding document known as the â œtrillion tonne communiquã opens in a new window â the communiquã is a project sponsored by the prince of walesâ s corporate leaders group which brings together business leaders to address climate change the document puts the signatories on the record as advocating for the development of ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and timelines to bring global greenhouse gas emissions to â œnet zeroâ by the end of the century â œthis communiquã sends a clear message from business at a critical time when events in the ukraine have refocused global attention on energy security and just as the scientific consensus reminds us all of the imperative of collective action â said eliot whittington deputy director of the corporate leaders group in a press release in signing the communiquã shell endorsed the idea of limiting cumulative greenhouse gas emissions to less than trillion tonnes of carbon since the start of the industrial era as recommended by the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in a report opens in a new window released in september this endorsement was a notable move for an energy company considering that meeting that goal would put the companyâ s main sources of revenue at risk while shell has been investing in alternative fuels like wind and biofuels as well as advanced but so far unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage opens in a new window most of its revenue still comes from its oil and gas operations its arctic drilling activities opens in a new window have drawn the attention of environmental groups such as greenpeace which has protested the company â œwithout a clear and focused plan to manage our use of fossil fuels we cannot achieve our target of keeping global cumulative emissions below a trillion tonnes â says a frequently asked questions document accompanying the communiquã â œthe signatories to the communiquã want a policy response to the risks posed by climate change â the document says â œbusinesses that sign the communiquã want to be a part of the solution in meeting this challenge and support a policy response at a sub national national and international level â kelly levin a senior research associate at the world resources institute in washington who has researched the implications of the ipccâ s carbon budget told mashable that shellâ s decision along with the other companies that signed the communiquã is a positive sign â œi think it is quite significant that major businesses have come out to support what implies a degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit goalâ and in strong support of climate change science â levin said referring to the goal of limiting global warming to no more than degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels the global average temperature has already increased by f between the ipcc said simulated global mean surface temperature increase as a function of cumulative total global emissions credit in signing the communiquã shell did not commit itself to taking any actions to reduce its carbon footprint and its move could be viewed as an attempt at greenwashing its image however despite the non binding nature of the document its actions sent a dramatically different message than exxon s approach in two carbon risk reports opens in a new window which were released on march exxon said it plans to exploit all of its massive oil and natural gas reserves both existing and future finds through which would emit at least gigatons of carbon one gigaton is equal to billion tons this strategic planning decision amounted to a slap in the face of environmental advocates as well as scientists who have said the world can only withstand a limited amount of additional greenhouse gas emissions before global temperatures increase to levels that would have a higher chance of destabilizing global ice sheets and raising sea levels high enough that adaptation would be nearly impossible in the first installment of its lengthy and highly technical fifth assessment report on the science of climate change the ipcc found that in order to have at least a chance of limiting global warming to degrees fahrenheit or less compared to preindustrial levels which world leaders agreed to opens in a new window in the total cumulative emissions since the start of the industrial era would be limited to trillion tonnes of carbon or less about half of this budget or billion tonnes of carbon had already been used up by and significant near term cuts in emissions would be required to stay within this budget going forward the ipcc said since a molecule of carbon dioxide can stay aloft for hundreds to more than a thousand years it is the cumulative emissions since the start of the industrial revolution that will determine the amount of eventual global warming and the impacts of that warming according to a study opens in a new window burning all proven and economically recoverable oil and gas reserves would put another billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere because carbon dioxide is not the only global warming gas the remaining carbon budget may actually be smaller than what the ipcc outlined if emissions continue to follow the current course the world would exceed the ipcc carbon budget in as little as years the ipcc said meeting the cumulative carbon budget would require having global emissions peak by and negative carbon emissions meaning more carbon is taken out of the atmosphere by plants and the oceans than is added by cars trucks and factories would need to begin by a new section of the ipccâ s voluminous fifth assessment report on climate science is due to be released on april and it will provide more details about ways to reduce emissions to meet the degree fahrenheit temperature target yet exxon is making no plans to bring its operations into line with the global carbon budget even in a non binding way in fact its shareholder climate reports made no mention of the budget concept at all instead exxon said it is prioritizing the need to meet the worldâ s growing energy demands through its

s total lunar eclipse series is not the end of the world,there has been a lot of interest recently in an upcoming series of lunar eclipses that begins april these are usually described as four blood moons and taken by some to prophesy upcoming disasters the total lunar eclipse of april opens in a new window will begin a so called tetrad series of eclipses that is making the rounds online as a potential harbinger of doom due in part to a recent book on the four blood moons that makes the dubious claim astronomers rarely if ever use the term blood moon when they do they are usually using it as an alternate name for the hunter s moon the full moon that follows the harvest moon usually in late october the hunter s moon like the harvest moon rises slowly on autumn evenings so that it shines through a thick layer of the earth s atmosphere and is colored red by rayleigh scattering and air pollution lunar eclipses explained a lunar eclipse opens in a new window is something quite different it occurs when the moon passes through the earth s shadow the earth s shadow consists of two parts a dark inner core called the umbra and a lighter outer part called the penumbra rather than being truly dark the inner shadow is usually tinted orange or red by light passing through the ring of atmosphere surrounding the earth depending on the atmospheric conditions on earth in the band of atmosphere through which the sun s light is passing the umbra may take on a range of colors from light coppery red to almost total black the light illuminating an eclipsed moon is coming from thousands of sunsets and sunrises around the earth during some eclipses these sunsets and sunrises are clear and much light passes through during others clouds may block the light causing a dark eclipse the blood moon on rare occasions the light reaching the moon is exactly the color of blood opens in a new window but there is no way of predicting this in advance so there are no grounds to call any particular lunar eclipse a blood moon until it actually shows its color because the moon s orbit is slightly tilted with respect to the sun s path across the sky most of the time the moon passes above or below the earth s shadow and no eclipse occurs sometimes it passes only through the penumbra and produces what is called a penumbral eclipse a moon so lightly shaded that the casual observer might not even notice a difference there were two such penumbral eclipses in on may and oct sometimes the moon only dips slightly into the central shadow and it produces a partial lunar eclipse one of these occurred last year on april the rarest of all lunar eclipses are those in which the moon passes through the darkest part of the shadow a true total lunar eclipse opens in a new window this last happened on dec four blood moons the lunar eclipse tetrad what is unusual about this month s lunar eclipse is that it is the first of a series of four total lunar eclipses in a row called a tetrad such a series of four total eclipses in a row is a fairly rare event the last such series happened in the years and it will only occur seven more times in the current century so while a tetrad of total lunar eclipses is somewhat rare it is not extraordinarily so and probably nothing to make a fuss about after all the only thing that happens during a lunar eclipse is that the moon opens in a new window spends a couple of hours passing through the earth s shadow hardly something to be concerned about unfortunately there are still many superstitious people in the world such is the case in the book four blood moons something is about to change worthy publishing by john hagee which suggests a link between the new total lunar eclipse tetrad and biblical prophecy about the end times when the mechanisms behind eclipses were less well understood they were thought to be omens of bad tidings just as comets were now people know that these are just normal events in the clockwork of the solar system things which have occurred regularly for thousands of years and which will occur for thousands of years into the future associations between disastrous events and normal astronomical events opens in a new window are all fabrications of the human mind as people attempt to find explanations for why disasters affect them because of the internet and cable news channels people now hear reports of disasters from around the world including earthquakes tsunamis and volcanic eruptions which they never would have been aware of in the past it s almost inevitable that something bad will happen right after an eclipse or a visit from a comet for ardent skywatchers who derive much pleasure from beautiful events like lunar eclipses it s sad that there are prophets of doom in the world who view these life enriching events as portents of disaster,1

to succeed in business without becoming a workaholic,i watched wolf of wall street recently which inspired several flashbacks to my days in finance working in the pit for a large bank seeing those crowded trading desks and excited sales traders reminded me how hard most of those people worked to try to get ahead probably too hard while iâ m sure many firms dealing on wall street did their fair share of after hours partying i never saw it mostly because it seemed that hardly anyone ever left the office long enough to get up to much mischief the first people in the office were almost always among the last to leave and i remember witnessing more than a few contrite phone calls to spouses and loved ones as my co workers canceled on yet another dinner birthday party or family vacation sure there was probably a lot of money on the table but was working hour days really the way to success fortunately i have also worked with a few successful people throughout my career who managed to keep climbing the corporate ladder without stomping all over their personal lives opens in a new window in the process here are a few lessons iâ ve learned from them over the years on how to achieve success at workâ without selling your soul lesson gain a loyal following having co workers employees or team members you can turn to at work is great for a lot of reasonsâ but itâ s also an ideal strategy for helping you accomplish more than you ever thought possible take one of my old bosses for example she had worked for the firm for over a decade and knew everyoneâ s job inside and out she was a great mentor opens in a new window and easy to work with and she always came to bat for us when we needed her as a result the team was fiercely loyal to her if one of us saw her staying late weâ d ask her how we could help so she could go home if she had to give a presentation or leave town for a conference a handful of us would jump to help her prepare or cover her workload while she was out the team was so loyal to her that she rarely had to ask us to do anythingâ we almost always offered first as a result we were one of the most efficient successful teams in our division and no one had any doubt it was due in large part to our fearless leader having loyal employees who will go above and beyond to help you is something you couldnâ t achieve on your own no matter how many nights and weekends you worked yes youâ ll have to put in some extra hours and effort up front but once youâ ve proven yourself to your team their loyalty will already begin to pay dividends lesson outsource this concept is nothing new but for those of us with specific ideas on how a job should be approached itâ s a difficult one to put into practice but ignore the benefit of outsourcing or delegating and youâ ll quickly find yourself burning the midnight oil take my boss a few years back as a cautionary example he was a perfectionist and had high standards for the work our team produced those high standards naturally rubbed off on the rest of the team and before long we were fully capable of performing all our duties to the highest standard unfortunately our boss had a difficult time letting go and would often micromanage us so severely that he eventually just took over our projects himself by the time he was finished he was behind on his own work thankfully my boss eventually realized he had to start letting go opens in a new window he started out by delegating the tasks he knew he couldnâ t finish and before long he was comfortable outsourcing larger projects once the work was more evenly distributed he was happier at workâ and finally had the time to actually manage the team if youâ re starting feel like your work is taking over your entire life itâ s probably time to start thinking about outsourcing some of your responsibilities start with smaller tasks and gradually add more responsibility as you become comfortable with the results just make sure you donâ t micromanage the process and before you know it youâ ll have more time to focus on your professional growthâ and youâ ll be a lot happier at work lesson make a to do and a done list iâ ve always been a big fan of lists and theyâ re an especially important ingredient for attaining workplace success while minimizing your workload not only do lists help you keep track of what you need to accomplish but theyâ re also a great historical record of what youâ ve achieved iâ ll never forget a conversation i was having with a boss years ago when he admitted he didnâ t really know what i did on a daily basis i politely excused myself and ran to my desk and grabbed my trusty notebook when i returned we sat down and i flipped through over a yearâ s worth of daily lists detailing everything from large long term projects to daily deadlines he was impressed with how much more i was doing and when our year end comp discussion rolled around a few months later i had no objections to the raise i had asked for lists will keep you organized and on track when youâ re overloaded with work but more importantly theyâ ll serve as a historical record of how awesome you are and when you can point to a list that shows exactly what youâ ve accomplishedâ well then youâ ll have to worry less about making sure your boss knows youâ re clocking hours each day lesson redefine â œsuccessâ one of the saddest sights iâ ve seen in my career is of an executive holed up in her office late at night on a friday before a long weekend there was no doubt sheâ d become a massive success at workâ but well that was about it she worked tirelessly and never allowed herself any time for fun or relaxation as a result she was perpetually tired and as far as the rest of the team could tell she no longer loved the job sheâ d sacrificed so much for on the flip side there was her colleague weâ ll call betty betty was just as successful however she made a point to create and uphold strict work life boundaries during working hours betty was a machine but when quitting time rolled around she was out the door opens in a new window and never looked back management respected her efficiency her team loved working for her and her family still recognized her face in my book betty got it right you probably canâ t enjoy your job if youâ re overworked and exhaustedâ and the more you enjoy your work the better youâ ll be at your job if you set boundaries have a life outside of work and take time to recharge whenever you can opens in a new window youâ ll likely find youâ re much more productiveâ and successfulâ from

was cbs late show guy since and yes he ll keep the name,stephen colbert will end the colbert report when his contract expires at the end of take a break and start gearing up to take over the late show most likely in the fall of capping an informal succession plan that s been in motion going back as far as december mashable has learned and thereâ s no need to switch to an americanized pronunciation of his name colbert wonâ t go back to kohl bert but will keep the soft ending kohl bayr which he took on back in college it was a personal choice not as part of any schtick and he s not the only member of his family to use the more french leaning pronunciation but colbert will definitely leave the ego charged pseudo conservative personality behind how he does it will be fun to watch with eight months left of his comedy central show colbert will have plenty of time to orchestrate his own demise so to speak sources close to the show tell mashable i won t be doing the new show in character so we ll all get to find out how much of him was me i m looking forward to it â â colbert said in a statement emailed to mashable will â œstephen colbertâ the character be killed off outright will he be subsumed into stephen colbert the man you can bet colbertâ s creative talents will be maxed out for the transition and seeing as cbs and comedy central are close corporate cousins theyâ ll have some wiggle room to play with the transition letterman announced last thursday that he was retiring with the timetable tbd the following day mashable first reported that colbert was cbsâ first choice and that the colbert report host was interested in taking the job on thursday cbs made it official with a statement that colbert had signed a five year contract several media outlets quoted network executives saying the deal came together quickly after letterman s retirement including breakneck negotiations with several candidates but individuals close to the succession plans tell mashable that colbert and cbs began talking as early as december about him taking over the late show upon lettermanâ s retirement at that point the timing was still a big unknown throughout the process the network was determined to let letterman go out on his own terms and at a time of his choosing though colbert and the network never entered into any formal discussions until after letterman s announcement a handshake deal was made cbs wanted colbert colbert was stoked to succeed letterman and the rest would be worked out later the network still entertained calls from interested parties the chatter among the broadcast community was that jon stewart was once considered for the job but he ultimately faded out of the picture over the past few years the daily show gained prominence most watched in late night among the demographic and stewartâ s other interests he just finished directing his first feature film began to make a five nights a week network gig look time prohibitive it s been said that colbert has been synching his contract to match up with letterman s there may be some truth in that but colbert re upped with comedy central in july to run through several months before letterman signed a one year contract in october of last year if that maneuvering was indeed purposeful it worked out craig ferguson whose late late show comes on after letterman s was never seen as a true contender for the slot it remains to be seen whether heâ ll stick around at cbs after being passed over other names thrown in the mix were chelsea handler and neil patrick harris but even as top contenders they were dark horses at best for nearly months colbert was cbs guy one of colbert s priorities was sign off from letterman whom he deeply admires the two are friendly colbert has been a regular guest on the late show and the two had a conversation several weeks ago about a possible transition it went well and in a subsequent conversation after letterman s announcement dave gave stephen the blessing he d sought letterman kept his final broadcast date vague but itâ s likely to happen around october around the end of one broadcast season and the beginning of a new one that gives colbert less than a year between the end of the colbert report and a reboot of the late show which is in all probability staying in new york as colbert has deep family ties on the east coast but colbert wonâ t likely wait until the end of to start noodling on the concept of his new show when weâ ll finally get to see the man behind the persona before colbertâ s ascension was made official by cbs that man got one big endorsement from his buddy and lead in man stewart â œheâ s done an amazing job with just that very narrow cast of character but heâ s got a lot more he can show â stewart told vulture opens in a new window for a story posted early thursday â œheâ s got some skill sets that are very applicable interviewing wise but also heâ s a really really good actor and also an

known for wordpress com opens in a new window is completely distributed meaning its employees work from home or they can work from home matt mullenweg the ceo of automattic notes that the company has a physical headquarters in san francisco well you ve got to have somewhere to get mail he explains while a handful of employees work in the san francisco office the rest are flung across cities it allows you to get the best and brightest people in the world mullenweg says automattic gives its employees a monthly stipend of to get a co working space if their home office situation isn t great as an automattic employee you also get up to to set up your home office not far from automattic s san francisco office are some of the world s biggest tech companies apple google yahoo none of them share his vision of a distributed company apple is built on a culture of secrecy that views working remotely as an unnecessary risk google provides free meals to persuade employees to stay at company headquarters all hours of the day yahoo ceo marissa mayer famously required telecommuting employees to start coming into the office in in order to foster a culture of innovation other distributed companies like github woothemes mozilla and upworthy are outliers in despite advances in technology over the past few decades and the ubiquity of broadband full time telecommuters are a tiny minority that may be changing though as a new wave of distributed companies challenge the status quo the telecommuting concept in the early jack nilles a rocket scientist at nasa was contemplating the next big challenge for mankind one regional planner said if you can put a man on the moon how come you can t do something about traffic nilles recalled recently the proverbial light went off in my head nilles solution was telecommuting a term he is credited with coining in reasoning that many people on the road were traveling to and from jobs nilles decided to address the necessity of commuting in that pre pc era telecommuting had a different meaning nilles first telecommuting project was with an insurance company that was looking to increase its employee retention rate rather than let them work from home which was impossible back then the company set up satellite offices employees could then walk bike or take the bus to go to work the introduction of pcs was a eureka moment nilles recalled now those same employees didn t need to commute at all but could do their jobs from their homes in their pajamas if they wished in the ensuing three decades the technology that allows for telecommuting has gotten better and better in you can videoconference share documents and collaborate in real time from your pc tablet or phone yet very few people work from home full time in just million people opens in a new window of the u s employee workforce worked from home full time some million employees had jobs that were telework compatible according to global workplace analytics the group claims that if all those employees worked from home just days a week for a year then the reduction in greenhouse gases million tons would be equivalent to taking the entire new york workforce off the roads great damage to the environment could be avoided if more people worked from home and if more businesses let them but that s not happening because of managers fear and mistrust and current gaps in technology as the latter improves though managers may begin to get more comfortable with letting their employees work remotely even full time new companies could also be completely distributed and lack a physical headquarters saving overhead costs media richness theory on the other hand consider serendipity if you put dozens or thousands of creative people under one roof a few might connect and create something that they wouldn t have thought of if they stayed home in their pajamas it s a sort of riff on the infinite monkey theorum opens in a new window which states that if you put monkeys in a room for a long enough time they ll produce shakespeare we do our best work when weâ re physically connected says roy hirshland ceo of advisors a commercial real estate advisor dialing in on skype will work in a pinch but it s not a substitute he says when you re in the same room you can see facial expressions you can feel energy in a room the idea is based on media richness theory which posits that some tasks require face to face interaction skype doesn t fit the bill skype is a great free way to communicate with sound and picture but with glitchy connections awkward camera angles the limitations of webcams and cheap microphones etc says dr matthew lombard a professor at temple university and president of the international society for presence research it s far from the same experience as talking to someone in person face time and other tablet and phone methods have the advantage of mobility but they suffer in terms of the vividness of the experience narrow bandwidth tech like text based chat rooms and messaging and email are great for specific relatively straight forward dry cognitive tasks but not so good for things that involve ambiguity and emotion lombard says so there are an awful lot of tasks people need to complete in business and certainly in life generally that don t lend themselves well to these technologies a more negative slant on this is that managers don t trust their employees the c suite largely gets the business case for telecommuting but middle managers are largely resistant why because they simply donâ t know how to manage says kate lister president of global workplace analytics they mistake presence for performance if they can see the back of someoneâ s head they assume that person is working in business circles this is known as managing by walking around lister says that s a century construct if managers are not managing by results or outcomes they re not managing they re babysitting she says mullenweg agrees it s easier to slack off in that office than if you re working remotely he says if you come into an office and are well dressed and on time you assume people are working because they look busy at home all you have is your output did you commit the code did you write the post did you make the proposal there s no theater of physical proximity some studies also show that remote workers are more productive chinese travel site ctrip for instance found employees that worked from home made opens in a new window more calls than workers in the office did such workers also reported higher job satisfaction than their office bound cohorts a brigham young university study also found that office based workers found it hard to manage their work and home life after logging hours in a week for telecommuters the limit was hours distributed companies a recent automattic company meetup in santa cruz calif credit automattic some entrepreneurs like mullenweg see telecommuting employees as an untapped resource and have launched distributed companies while no one tracks the number of such companies flexjobs opens in a new window a site that lists telecommuting and flexible hours jobs saw a increase in job postings from to brie weiler reynolds director of online content at flexjobs says she still thinks that telecommuting jobs are in the small minority woothemes opens in a new window which makes wordpress plug ins and themes is an almost distributed company thirty seven people work for woothemes and are flung across the world however the company does have a nine person office in cape town south africa mark forrester co founder of woothemes says having such a structure can be difficult being distributed doesnâ t come without itâ s fair share of compromises he says noting that tax paperwork is particularly tricky when your staff are all based in different countries communication can also be a challenge a text conversation can often be misconstrued so we try and jump on a regular google hangout with team members to get some face to face time these hangouts are hugely valuable as well as entertaining we also try to meet up once a year as a team somewhere new and different these trips increase in cost as our team grows but we see both huge tangible and intangible benefit from them like woothemes automattic also organizes trips a few times a year so employees can have some face time what we save on office space we blow on travel he says employees get to pick the location of such semi yearly conferences once there they get to know each other better mullenweg says we do some things like ideation and brainstorming that work better in person he says we don t need to do this every day there are other ways to promote a corporate culture without physical closeness reynolds says her company which is itself distributed hosts online yoga sessions and uses social media to foster a corporate culture we use yammer as our watercooler she says we post pics of our dogs dressed up for halloween reynolds says she believes there s nothing preventing a distributed company from being as big as google as long as you re really thinking about corporate culture and looking for a way to build your workforce she says it s really that forethought that makes a company reach that level jeff atwood the ceo of discourse opens in a new window says that savvy startups are realizing the advantage of using telecommuting as a recruiting tool there s a lot of talent that s is very very untapped he says tapping that talent is a strategic advantage atwood believes that tech is a canary in the coal mine for a workplace change over the next generation,0

humanity while tucker feels we have yet to encounter a technology that has made this happen he pointed out that â œour sense of humanity can undergo a rapid evolution and this can be disorienting and alienating creating a feeling of loss what weâ re talking about is a multiplication of humanity across different spaces and that will feel very strange but it doesnâ t represent a permanent lossâ itâ s a doubling of humanity â i sympathize with this sense of loss i do feel disoriented when looking around my living room and noting that my wife son and daughter are all tethered to screens iâ m keenly aware of the almost chemical need to check my phone while listening to a family member speak oftentimes missing what theyâ re saying while my eyes dart towards my phone in these scenarios i donâ t know what a doubling of humanity will look like perhaps real time notifications will only invade my consciousness with messages iâ ve deemed important but my current behaviors mirror addiction more than enlightenment â œpeople are becoming anti social before phones you were always thinking about what conversations you could make with someone else now many people prefer their phone over conversations with humans â says mrigaen kapadia kapadia and his wife co founded a company mobifolio opens in a new window and developed breakfree opens in a new window an app aimed at controlling phone addiction it monitors your mobile usage and tracks how addicted you are to your phone registering how often you swipe to unlock your screen or which apps you use on a too frequent basis when i asked mrigaen if prolonged engagement with technology could be deemed personal preference as opposed to addiction he cited a video showing two japanese men in their thirties who chose to interact with virtual girlfriends instead of dealing with human ones he cited it as a dangerous precedent â œwe want to make people realize that human company is better than phone company â he said but is this a universal truth i recently wrote a book opens in a new window on the nature of technology and happiness and found a great deal of research showing that our intrinsic wellbeing does increase when weâ re with our families friends or community but whoâ s to say that community needs to be carbon versus silicon perhaps weâ ll only prefer human company to machines until technology advances to the point where we canâ t tell the difference and odds are weâ ll start to prefer cyborgian humans to the â œreal thingâ because theyâ ll be programmable and will never get sick weâ ll get all the benefits of human interaction without a lot of our current struggles this idea still makes me feel wonky but it may be my age colin the nyu student had a different take on the japanese men s cyber girlfriends â œit doesnâ t matter that she lives in a computerâ the woman makes him happy whether sheâ s biology or technology doesnâ t matter anymore â he said the heart of being human â œwisdom is seeing through false identities â notes vincent horn co founder of buddhist geeks opens in a new window the wildly popular podcast and now annual conference opens in a new window â œwisdom is seeing through the ways in which we cling to conceptions of who we are and what the world is that are out of synch with how things are functioning â this insight from my interview with vincent was particularly compelling like patrick tuckerâ s noting how change can bring a sense of alienation perhaps my current sense of anxiety comes from clinging to a form of humanity that is now out of date today the world functions almost more digitally than not at least in the visible spectrum but our consciousness is tied to our screens and data on an ever expanding basis itâ s in this in between space that i donâ t know how to function horn points out that â œwe canâ t hold on to any particular thing â it changes the next instant itâ s when we do hold onto it that it causes suffering and pain â,0

to ask when you re interviewing interns,a great intern can be a huge win for your work life you have another set of hands on board to help with unfinished projects or tackle the much needed research that just seems to sit there waiting for you to have time for it youâ ll have a few extra hours in the day to get to those bigger things youâ ve been wanting to youâ ll have the opportunity to serve as a mentor opens in a new window and coach and develop your own leadership and managerial skills and a not so great intern well ask anyone whoâ s had one that situation can be more trouble than itâ s worth but sniffing out the latter category from the former can be tough when most interns donâ t come to the table with much work experience or professional skills what do you ask in an interview if you donâ t have past positions to use as a gauge just remember the goals of interviewing a prospective intern are the same as interviewing a job candidate opens in a new window you want to learn about the personâ s skills and abilities assess their interest in your company and determine whether or not theyâ ll be a good fit with your team here are a few questions in each of those categories to get you started you want to know do they have the skills and abilities tell me about your coursework in what ways is it relevant to this position even the most mundane college class has some professional benefit to it there are the obvious ways if youâ re looking for a pr intern then having someone who is majoring in marketing or public relations and has worked on projects that relate to your industry is a clear connection but other classes have indirect benefits opens in a new window as well for example writing papers takes research organization time management and editing skills and foreign language classes require communicating effectively in a diverse environment by having candidates identify and articulate those connections youâ ll get a good sense of where their strengths lie tell me about your volunteer or community service experience experiences like volunteering in the community planning on campus events or participating in clubs or greek life can be incredibly valuable in developing professional skills i once hired an intern who had no paid work experience but a resume chock full of impressive volunteer work she planned an annual for cancer research on her campus for three years hello leadership and event planning skills worked at the local elementary school reading to children clearly she was responsible and was the treasurer of her sorority i e had top notch budget management and organization skills asking candidates to describe what theyâ ve learned and gained from these experiences can be a great way to determine what theyâ ll bring to a professional setting what skills do you want to gain from this experience and what skills can you offer us sometimes just asking the question directly is best candidates may have great skills that arenâ t reflected in their coursework or on campus activity or they may know that they need experience in a certain area and that your internship will provide them with just that either way look for people who have really thought through what theyâ ll bring to and take from the opportunity you want to know are they interested in your company why do you want to intern here sometimes students just need an internship and theyâ ll take it where they can get it but the best candidates the ones who will likely work hard and be excited to learn more about your industry and function will be applying because they respect your companyâ s mission or have some connection to the work that is done look for people who are really compelled to join your team what do you know about our company what questions do you still have as with any good job interview you want an intern candidate who has done his or her research opens in a new window ask a few questions that will reveal knowledge of your company or not for example is there a program that sheâ s most interested in or does he have a thought on your most recent press release in addition letting candidates ask questions about the company and role can reveal their ability to think critically about what theyâ ve learned you want to know will they fit in what are your expectations asking candidates what their expectations of the internship are is a great way to ascertain whether or not they understand your company and the work theyâ ll be doing making sure both you and the candidate are clear about the work involved the required hours and the pay if any is the first step to ensuring a successful setup for both of you what do you know about the industry an intern will become a member of your team and will likely interact with other colleagues vendors and clients at some point so you want to be sure that anyone you bring on is familiar with basic industry jargon programs and procedures or at the very least will be excited to learn about them a candidate who has done informational interviews regularly reads industry blogs or has a vested interest in the field will always be better than one whoâ s just trying to get experience anywhere what are your goals after graduation learning about candidatesâ long term goals can give you insight into the kind of people they are and want to become they donâ t necessarily have to perfectly align with the role and industry but the internship will be a better experience for both of you if itâ s at least somewhat related especially if youâ re hoping your intern will eventually turn into a full time hire a candidate who say aspires to work for a large investment banking firm after graduation might not be a great fit in your mission driven nonprofit,1

airbnb of boats makes getting on the water easy,eric collins spent three years watching diners dock their boats at sam s anchor cafe the waterfront establishment where he works on san francisco bay but could never afford to buy his own until now the san franciscan purchased a chris craft launch opens in a new window three weeks ago only after learning that he could subsidize the cost on a peer to peer or as the company calls it pier to pier boat sharing service boatbound opens in a new window essentially an airbnb for boats has been steadily growing since its launch in the site is fresh off a recent financing round that raised million and lists nearly boats a far cry from the approximately it started with but perhaps more importantly than its financial success boatbound is making boating more accessible to the public i think there was a lot of latent demand for this aaron hall boatbound founder and ceo told mashable people wanted a boat they just couldn t figure out how to do it the general premise is one we ve seen before renters can book boats for a fee that owners have listed on the site instead of staying in a loft in soho or an english flat however wannabe captain jack sparrows can spend time on the open waters without breaking the bank on a craft of their own listings include prices set by owners photos descriptions a calendar of available dates and a space for renters to post reviews of different listings the cheapest boats on the site are kayaks and canoes that go for about a day the most expensive at a day is the foot yacht that was featured on the lonely island s i m on a boat opens in a new window video yes you too can be a on a boat it s really going to make it a lot easier and a lot stress free collins told mashable i get to spend time doing something i enjoy and helping other people too credit boatbound cost and time are two of the biggest deterrents to boat ownership the price of the initial purchase can vary wildly depending on the type of boat not all of them are hundreds of thousands of dollars but when you factor in things such as gasoline storage and general repairs which can take huge chunks of time out of your day renting a boat only when you want to use it may seem like the preferable option boatbound can also offset costs for owners much like renting out a vacation home on weekends you re not there plus it s an easy way to test out a boat you may be thinking of purchasing buying a boat is really tough scott croft a spokesman for the boat owners association of the united states opens in a new window told mashable i think this helps people who may be on the fence of boat ownership it lets them test the waters hall came up with the idea for boatbound out of personal necessity he grew up boating but on a trip to visit family in texas two years ago he couldn t find a boat available for rent despite the many that were sitting unused at a nearby marina his team in palo alto calif was working on a wedding related startup at the time but changed course once hall pitched his idea for a boat sharing service the biggest hurdle was insurance it took six months to set up a system given that boats aren t as standardized as vehicles such as cars for which there is an established rental industry there are more than million registered recreational boats in the united states according to a national marine manufacturers association study opens in a new window however the average boat is only used for approximately days during the year according to a united states coast guard study opens in a new window you don t need any experience to use boatbound but some states have stricter regulations than others about licenses and other qualifications sometimes owners such as tom cavers opens in a new window in san francisco will teach renters about their craft before handing it over especially if the newly minted seafarers don t have much experience some boats can now be booked with a certified captain if renters simply want to enjoy the ride the first time someone rents we spend about half an hour on the boat going through everything how it works talking through sailing on san francisco bay and where they re going to go cavers told mashable these interactions can create long lasting friendships teresa fitzsimmons who owns a boat opens in a new window in south florida said she still keeps in touch with almost everyone who has rented her craft fitzsimmons partner even made a business connection through boatbound she works for a large healthcare company and it just so happened that a major player in the industry s san francisco market rented their boat this focus on community is part of hall s plan for boatbound there are events such as local meetups and owner appreciation days he said adding that the company is working on more ways to enhance the boating experience similar services include incredibule opens in a new window getmyboat opens in a new window and cruzin opens in a new window among others but according to croft boatbound appears to be leading the pack the site has raised million in total to date hall said its most recent round of funding will be used to expand its reach within the united states and internationally as well as to focus on existing markets currently boats can be posted from anywhere in the world but listings are still concentrated in a few areas such as san francisco and south florida to date boatbound has had million in planned bookings according to a press release opens in a new window it has also been building relationships with organizations such as boatus the american sailing association opens in a new window and the brunswick corporation opens in a new window the site itself underwent a recent redesign to make it more accessible to mobile users since to of people access it on the go according hall it amazed me how quickly people wanted to make this a great thing hall said we wanted to make people feel like they were a part of something and i think we ve done that,1

proof that brazil is world cup soccer s true home,the world cup officially kicks off in brazil two months from saturday off the pitch worries massive protests and crime chief among them are well founded to be sure but when it comes to soccer itself and how brazilians regard the beautiful game brazil is the world cup s one true home you ll hear this over and over between now and june but forget all that vague pontification we have firsthand proof i had the good fortune of attending a very big deal soccer match at the maracana rio de janeiro s legendary stadium that will host the world cup final on july at the end of a long backpacking trip through south america in in years of attending all range of sports events at multiple levels in multiple countries the maracana on the night of june remains the single most insane atmosphere i ve ever witnessed and i use insane in the most complimentary way possible more than an hour before the match was even scheduled to start fans had already filled the maracana capacity nearly to capacity fans from both sides rio based host fluminense and the visiting boca juniors of buenos aires argentina chanted loudly then they chanted more and louder and more and louder some beat drums others waved a total of hundreds if not thousands of balloons the vibe was aggressive and manically passionate but didn t feel dangerous this despite flares burning in the stands and at times rendering visibility near zero thanks to their smoke firecrackers were also popular no celebratory fan accessory it seemed was off limits the maracana was too turnt up on june credit sam laird below is a second video i shot on my camera i was sitting behind one goal the flashes and flares you see in the distance through the smoke are coming from fans clear across the stadium perhaps you can catch little glimpses of field through the madness now here s a clearer longer and slightly tamer look at the pre game madness the old brazilian man dancing to my right who makes his first appearance about five seconds in was pretty much the coolest guy ever why all the fuss this match mattered fluminense and boca juniors were squaring off in the second leg of their copa libertadores semifinal matchup the copa libertadores the south american equivalent of europe s champions league takes the top teams from each domestic league to create one continent wide mega tournament every year the winner of this matchup would go on to the copa libertadores finals the loser s season would be over boca juniors is probably the most iconic club in south america so fluminense supporters were extra motivated to roll out their best un welcome mat and here s the topper fluminense and boca had tied during the first leg of their semifinal a week before meaning that this second leg was for all the marbles whoever won here was booking a ticket to the final period a father and his two young kids a boy and a girl sat in the row in front of me they were brazilian and

young s long fight to restore the quality of music,neil young has been disappointed by the sound of his own music for more than years back in young listened to some of his songs on a cd for the first time and couldn t help but question what had happened to the sound quality cds had just come to market that year and some like young believed there was a noticeable drop in quality from vinyl and certainly from what was heard in the recording studio that fidelity only worsened in the years that followed as the industry shifted to downloads and streaming music the evolution or devolution of music formats weighed on him i felt really guilty about selling young told mashable in an interview earlier this month people were paying for this thing that was only a fraction of what i created it sounds so compromised that you really don t get the feeling of the music you don t get into the depth of the music and get the soul of it because there s not enough of it there sometime around the turn of the century young says he began thinking about the sound quality problem more he thought about trying to introduce a cloud based music system for higher quality tracks but realized the bandwidth wasn t there he considered a download model that would work on smartphones but came to believe the system required a dedicated music player at one point young even talked with apple s visionary cofounder steve jobs about the project but he says jobs believed an ipod was as good as it needed to be for what it was he was right but he went home and listened to vinyl young says of jobs thinking with a laugh he didn t even bother to have conversations with other top tech executives they were succeeding they were selling lots of he explains people had never heard anything else what s the problem there was no problem about three years ago young started laying the foundation for a standalone company called ponomusic pono means righteousness in hawaiian that would develop an ecosystem for high quality digital music the first product a toblerone shaped device would let users store digital albums of studio master quality music that they would be purchased through a dedicated online marketplace in essence it would function like an ipod to give music listeners of all types access to the sweet full sounds of vinyl or better the pono music player would be like young himself something very much out of time first edition pono player credit pono kickstarter the worst kept secret when john hamm not to be confused with mad men s jon hamm was first introduced to young through one of the company s board members a little over a year ago ponomusic was only a business in the loosest sense of the word it consisted of a very small staff rotated through a couple ceos and had yet to advance beyond the prototyping stage for a product there was no business plan there was no real financing plan there was no sense of what the brand would be says hamm who eventually took over as ceo of ponomusic neil was focused on a lot of things that were part of his mission but that didn t have a realistic grounding in a business idea few musicians command as much respect as neil young over the course of a recording career spanning six decades he has sold millions of records been inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame and influenced artists ranging from bob dylan to pearl jam but his success recording music hasn t always translated to success starting businesses young invested in lionel trains and later invented a couple products for the company based on his love of model trains as david carr wrote in a profile opens in a new window of young in the new york times young lost a lot of money on his investment but heâ s still a board member at lionel and ended up with a lot of cool gear so it all sort of worked out the man who wrote the lyrics don t let it bring you down it s only castles burning is unsurprisingly not overly concerned about his business acumen or lack thereof i only do what i m interested in he says i just let the rest of it take care of itself young did choose to surround himself with a few business advisors to set up ponomusic and picked hamm to run the day to day operations so that neil young can do what neil young does best come up with ideas and connect with musicians and music fans that hasn t stopped young from pitching ideas that would be questionable for the business according to hamm young was interested in bringing bluetooth or wi fi to the music player and even pursue a second screen video experience both of which would be costly and difficult for the first generation device we just said to neil these are all great ideas but they need to come at their logical place in the evolution of the product hamm says the key was to ship a product this calendar year part of the reason for the rush is that young had already gone on a media blitz for the pono player back in talking about it in his autobiography opens in a new window in the new york times profile and even showing off an early version of the device during an appearance on the late show with david letterman it was one of the worst kept secrets in the world hamm says now the company needed to actually deliver a product kickstarter success after narrowing down the focus for a first generation product hamm and the ponomusic team made the decision over the winter to simultaneously do a public launch for the company its website and a kickstarter campaign at sxsw in march even by recent kickstarter standards the pono campaign opens in a new window has a jaw dropping number of stars in a promo video arcade fire tom petty norah jones eddie vedder david crosby and others all talk about the ear opening experience of using pono for the first time the inevitable press and perhaps the novel idea paid off the pono kickstarter campaign hit its funding goal in just one day contribution options range from in exchange for a thank you note on pono s website to to preorder the device to to have a vip listening party with young the campaign is now closing in on million from more than backers with four days to go making it the third most successful kickstarter campaign ever the goal of the campaign wasn t to raise funds but rather to raise awareness by introducing the idea to a broader audience hamm says the company did quietly raise funding through traditional means to finance getting the player to prototype stage as well as setting up contracts with the major record labels ponomusic had been in talks with about parties for a followup funding round but he says they probably wouldn t have been deals we would have liked at that point following the success of the kickstarter campaign the company is seeing more investor interest the plan is to do an equity financing round in may or june the next step for ponomusic will be to make good on delivering pre ordered devices starting in october as well as to build up its content library of high quality tracks provided by the major and independent labels beyond that the company is evaluating whether and how to innovate with home stereo systems to car systems the team argues that the kickstarter campaign is validation that there is a market for high quality music beyond just a handful of audiophiles i m gratified by the amount of pledges that we ve had young says it s going to be challenging for us to keep up with the demand for pono now that we have the ball rolling but we will do it pono is the third most funded kickstarter campaign ever behind the pebble smartwatch and ouya game console credit keep on rockin with or without pono despite the success that ponomusic has had on kickstarter some industry watchers doubt its market potential convenience trumps quality says james mcquivey vp and principal analyst with forrester research it s why works it s why streaming works it s possible he argues that pono could eventually attract a user base in the hundreds of thousands and become a sustainable niche business but he doesn t expect it to ever achieve mass market success young remains confident about pono s potential and will continue to invest much though not all of his time in the company i think pono is going to take a lot of time and a lot of dedication young says at the same time i continue to play my concerts and write songs and they don t seem to get in each other s way from the beginning he has had a bigger goal in mind than simply launching a business he wants to show consumers that there is another option for listening to music beyond regardless of what happens with pono young believes he has already succeeded on that mission,1

list investors million downloads is selfie app shots for real,there are two days that shots opens in a new window ceo john shahidi says he will never forget the first happened in december of when shahidi was still running the mobile gaming company rocklive he woke up to find one of his company s top mobile games heads up had crashed inexplicably after quickly scanning twitter to see what the game s users were saying he found the problem justin bieber had played the game and posted his top score on twitter the publicity had caused thousands of people to download and play the game it just crashed our servers shahidi told mashable it was the first time shahidi witnessed the power of bieber s social media influence first hand the second day he ll never forget took place in march it was the day bieber called shahidi in hopes of becoming a rocklive investor the only problem shahidi and his rocklive co founder his brother sammy didn t want to make games anymore they were exhausted â œtheyâ d blow up then theyâ d fall off the face of the earth â he explains bieber was such a fan of rocklive that he was interested in whatever company the duo wanted to build they wanted to make something that would last and ultimately make a difference they had the power of bieber s social media reach and they wanted to put it to good use so with bieber as an investor they left rocklive behind and created shots mobile and its first app shots a social network that specializes in one kind of photo sharing experience the selfie check out madisonellebeer opens in a new window â s selfie opens in a new window on shots opens in a new window in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â justin bieber justinbieber april opens in a new window shots which launched in november is an app that allows users to post a selfie to their followers much like other social media apps like facebook twitter snapchat or instagram the major difference is that shahidi wanted to build something safe for teenagers a social site where bullies don t exist and posting a selfie doesn t prompt criticism from friends or strangers the app only allows a user s friends to comment and only if they share a selfie of their own along with it people can t hide behind the keyboard he explains only the front facing camera works within the app and you can t upload from the camera roll that ensures people are taking photos in real time capturing their true identities says shahidi anyone reported for bullying is instantly kicked off the app the shots ios app launched in november and announced one million downloads last week credit shots app store this anti bullying approach is personal for shahidi who says that even at the age of he is still bullied online after being bullied as a child the social media abuse as an adult was a reminder of how that felt growing up he is still teased about his weight and for being a momma s boy of sorts before moving to the bay area last august shahidi had never lived more than two miles from his mother who raised him and his brother by herself â œ nothing thatâ s going to make me want to hurt myself but going back to someone whoâ s years younger than me or years old they are hurting themselves says shahidi the challenge behind marketing a bully free app is to make it cool says shahidi luckily shots has an investor who can make anything cool for teenagers when shots first launched of its user base also followed bieber on twitter that number is now down to which shahidi believes is a testament to the app s functionality how far though can an app solely focused on selfies really go pretty far if you ask shahidi the company announced million downloads on thursday and gets active users per month bieber and fellow investor floyd mayweather the boxer help market the app regularly by sharing selfies to their millions of twitter followers shots also has the audience coveted by social networks everywhere teenagers three quarters of shots users are females under the age of shots is not the only selfie style app making headlines frontback opens in a new window is also making a name for itself with high profile celeb

mayweather floydmayweather april opens in a new window although shots is nowhere near the top photo and video ios apps in the u s shahidi points to other countries like brazil and mexico where the app is routinely in the top in the same category according to app annie opens in a new window currently the app is also only available on ios but an android version is in the works says shahidi with stalwarts like facebook and twitter rolling out new features on a near weekly basis making it in the social network industry is no small challenge but shahidi is up for the challenge and believes users will see the difference in a network like shots if they give it a chance we re bigger than just building something with justin says shahidi this is something humanity really needs we want to

of thrones recap reasons to be sad king joffrey is dead,spoiler alert this post contains spoilers for season four episode two of game of thrones if you have not watched the episode stop reading now oh go on celebrate clap your hands whoop and do your happy dances ding dong king joffreyâ s dead blah blah blah youâ re going to be sad in the long run game of thrones fans yes king joffrey baratheon may have been the most vile and sadistic character in tv history yes every move he made was an act of unspeakable cruelty and unchecked delusion yes the little rat faced bastard deserved to die to those of us who havenâ t read george r r martinâ s books joffreyâ s poisoning at his wedding to margaery tyrell is not only lighting up the internet with schadenfreude but it sets up a delicious whodunit â perhaps the biggest since when dallasâ â œwho shot j r â episode lit up the uh the um â the phone lines letter writing campaigns anyway whatever they did back then but iâ m telling you losing joffrey is no good in terms of its impact on the dynamics of game of thrones itâ every bit as wrongheaded as ned stark losing his and here s why because now the show has no clear villain joffrey baratheon credit hbo com in terms of hatability joffrey made darth vader look like mister rogers just about everyone in game of thrones has some villainous streak but the inbred king of the seven realms was the nastiest of them all and he was in charge who are we rooting against now exactly when ned starkâ s sentence was carried out we lost the show s clear alpha hero now that both poles have been neutralized the big bright compass in the sky is truly spinning with no true north or south because his super annoying wife is probably going to be in charge margaery tyrell credit hbo com at least for a little while it couldnâ t be more obvious that margaery tyrell was in it for personal and political gain she and her duplicitous grandmother lady oleanna tyrell have to be suspects â margaery fed him that first bite of pie right as the widow of renly baratheon margaery already had a claim on the iron throne with the ceremony over she very well may inheret it but not since anne hathaway won her oscar has it been this difficult to root for the success of hyperambition but they never consummated the marriage â so is it legal margaery tyrell and joffrey baratheon credit hbo com itâ s not like anyone would have dared initiate the â œbedding ceremony â but man what a tease with joffreyâ s cruel proclivities thereâ s no telling what kind of awful bullet margaery dodged here whatâ s more who knows what kind of ascension ambiguities are introduced here because they never made the marriage you know official official because this looks really bad for tyrion obviously tyrion lannister credit hbo com poor tyrion just canâ t catch a break thereâ s just no way the imp would dare poison his nephew under such obvious circumstances â and yet there he was holding that fateful cup tyrion has gotten out of some tight spots but justice is swift and rarely rational in westeros with ceresi screeching accusations at her brother as the credits roll his chances of survival look slim please please please letâ s not lose tyrion over this one because the lannisters are sure to move down a few pegs house lannister credit hbo com full disclosure iâ m team lannister joffrey made that hard to admit but the charming clever tyrion and his pragmatic father tywin made up for it jaime lannister â his choice of mating partner notwithstanding â has proven himself a character worth rooting for especially now that heâ s on the comeback trail but unless ceresi thinks fast the lannisters time of influence may be cut short not that they didnâ t have it coming they did still there was something deliciously sinister about their brief and brutal reign and whoâ s going to step up to the extreme cruelty plate ramsay snow torments theon greyjoy credit hbo com game of thrones plays to the worst angels of our nature the sickening lack of humanity is practically the showâ s calling card but no one was better at it than joffrey and someoneâ s going to have to take a step up to fill the horror void ramsay snow with his treatment of theon greyjoy er sorry â œreekâ has the malevolence but the bastard son of lord roose bolton doesnâ t yet have the influence to carry out the large scale atrocities that joffrey could but his illegitimate father offers him a mission find jon snow and â œprove yourself a boltonâ â a chance to rise to prominence could g r r m be setting up the rise of the next sick bastard because this â who shot j r â moment could drag on for weeks and you thought true detective was a long march to satisfaction weâ re just getting started here ugh because so many people who owed him payback wonâ t get their chance sansa stark credit hbo com at least sansa stark got to see joffrey die before being spirited away in the commotion â presumably to safety but sheâ s just the first in a very very long line of got characters who with good reason to exact personal revenge on the boy king and who won t get that chance now because honestly he didnâ t suffer nearly enough for all the pain and cruelty for the countless lives cast into despair and death â and he chokes for seconds thatâ s it go ahead and ring the bells if you must but in his death king joffrey got nothing short of mercy thereâ s nothing satisfying about that,1

re running out of time to stop global warming un says,the window of opportunity to avoid an amount of global warming that global leaders have agreed would be â œdangerousâ is rapidly closing with just a decade left for the world to begin undertaking sweeping technological and governmental actions to rein in emissions of global warming gases such as carbon dioxide according to a new united nations report opens in a new window released sunday in berlin after that it becomes far more difficult and expensive to cut emissions sufficiently to avoid dangerous amounts of warming given recent emissions and temperature trends the world is on track to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to degrees fahrenheit by the end of this century the report says this could have disastrous consequences by dramatically raising global sea levels melting land based ice sheets and leading to more heat waves and extreme precipitation events among other impacts see also key findings from the new un climate science report the report the third and final installment of the latest comprehensive review of climate science from the nobel prize winning un intergovernmental panel on climate changeâ s ipcc analyzes more than scenarios of potential economic growth and environmental changes to determine how to minimize global warming the report is simultaneously optimistic and grim in tone since it concludes there is time and pre existing technological knowledge available to meet the goals that leaders set out in a non binding agreement opens in a new window in yet lays bare the sheer scope of the challenges that lie ahead ottmar edenhofer co chairman of the ipcc working group iii jochen flasbarth state secretary of the german environment ministry rejendra k pachauri chairman of the ipcc and jochen schuette state secretary of the german science ministry from left pose for the media prior to a meeting of the un ipcc in berlin germany on april credit michael sohn the central task for scientists engineers and policymakers is to figure out how to facilitate continued economic and population growth without also causing emissions to skyrocket at the same time the report says figuring out how to do that gets at the core of global development issues and the sharp climate policy divide between industrialized and developing nations government representatives meeting in berlin last week to approve the report objected to language in the widely read summary for policymakers opens in a new window that suggested developing countries have to do more to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions according to the new york times opens in a new window however such language remained in the lengthy technical report text discussing transfers of funding to developing countries to assist them in growing their economies without boosting emissions was also removed from the summary the ipccâ s fifth assessment provides the foundation for upcoming rounds of negotiations to craft a new global climate treaty starting with a high level climate summit in new york this september and culminating in another summit in paris next year the next treaty is supposed to be enforced by u s secretary of state john kerry said the report underscores the need for action by â œso many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper more readily available and better performing than they were when the last ipcc assessment was released less than a decade ago â kerry said in a statement â œthis report makes very clear we face an issue of global willpower not capacity â here are some of the reportâ s key findings weâ re not headed in the right direction if we want to limit global warming total manmade greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in human history from to and reached gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in the vast majority of that or about has come from burning fossil fuels for energy with smaller amounts coming from deforestation agriculture and other sources business as usual is not climate as usual atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are currently just above parts per million ppm and are already the highest in at least the past years under a business as usual scenario the report says carbon can be expected to soar to higher than ppm by this could lead to global warming ranging from degrees fahrenheit to degrees fahrenheit above pre industrial levels by the end of this century when the full range of scientific uncertainty is taken into account total annual manmade greenhouse gas emissions yr by groups of gases to at the right side of the figure greenhouse gas emissions in are shown again broken down into these components with the associated uncertainties confidence interval indicated by the error bars credit un ipcc the last years have brought a carbon boom the likes of which weâ ve never experienced before about half of all cumulative manmade carbon dioxide emissions between and occurred during the past years since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for hundreds to more than years the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming weâ re ultimately in store for and weâ ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than degrees fahrenheit that was the target world leaders agreed to in during a contentious round of un climate talks donâ t place all the blame on population growth the biggest factors contributing to the recent spike in greenhouse gas emissions are economic and population growth with economic growth playing the largest role in the last decade the report singles out the increased use of coal for electricity as the reason why the decarbonization of energy production has essentially halted emissions would have to be slashed asap to meet the degree fahrenheit target to have a good chance of limiting warming to less than degrees fahrenheit compared to pre industrial levels carbon dioxide levels would have to be kept below ppm by this would require emissions cuts of to by and near or below zero emissions by accomplishing this without paying an exorbitant cost would require that actions begin within the next decade yes that does say â œnear or below zero by to keep emissions low enough to avert the worst potential consequences of manmade global warming emissions donâ t just have to come down they have to hit the floor and keep on going the ipcc says the longer we wait to enact emissions cuts the worse climate change will be and the more expensive it will be waiting until to start reducing emissions would eliminate many of the more than policy scenarios examined in this report and increase the costs of cutting emissions as well as the costs of climate impacts part of the reason for this is that investments made today in power plants and buildings will lock in place particular levels of carbon emissions for up to a half century since such structures last a long time â œa decision to put up a building is a multidecadal decision â chris pyke one of the report s authors told mashable â œweâ re locking in choices and weâ re locking out the ability to do something else â renewable energy sources need to grow and fast most of the scenarios that involve relatively modest amounts of global warming include a rapid ramp up of renewable energy sources to where they contribute about of the global electricity supply by renewable energy technologies accounted for just over half of the new electricity generating capacity added worldwide in natural gas can be part of the solution replacing coal fired power plants with natural gas plants can reduce greenhouse gas emissions as long as high amounts of emissions do not occur when drilling for and transporting gas supplies efficiency is also key huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be made in the buildings sector since we already have the technology to make buildings more efficient for example of new york cityâ s emissions come from the buildings sector according to pyke,0

employee and had never had performance issues opens in a new window in her career but after long term success in a job she loved sheâ d just been assigned a new manager who was unlike any other he gave her the silent treatment iced her out of conversations and overall was a bit of a bully as a result margaret a positively positive and highly effective employee had turned into a rattled bunch of nerves she dreaded every interaction with this manager fearing that in sheer frustration sheâ d eventually blurt out â œi quit â opens in a new window without having any kind of backup plan she wanted to make it work it was a great job with a wonderful community of colleagues but she had no idea how she could perhaps like margaret youâ ve thought that if you put your nose to the grindstone do good work and have a can do attitude your career will be smooth sailing the problem is many other factors have an impact on your career too including the people around you and your relationships with them and when those people turn into stonewall managers and abrasive colleagues opens in a new window youâ ll need more than a good work ethic and positive attitude to effectively deal with them in short i told margaret â œyou canâ t â positive thinkâ your way out of this situation you need something more â thatâ s why i encourage all professionals to develop one extremely important skill as early in their careers as possible self advocacy this ability to assert what you need even if that means having difficult and potentially awkward conversations opens in a new window can be rewarding and confidence building and it plays a major part in ensuring that you get what you need to move your career forward but as you can probably guess itâ s not always easy read on to learn why this skill is so beneficial and some ways to start developing it in your own career why you must learn to advocate for yourself margaretâ s manager probably didnâ t know how miserable she was because she never brought it up you see managers and other authority figures will generally presume everything is ok unless you let them know otherwise for others to become aware that their behavior is unacceptable opens in a new window or that your needs arenâ t being met you need to tell them otherwise you simply reinforce their behavior when you embrace the practice of having these difficult conversations youâ ll be able to open up about what you need instead of backing off in fear youâ ll learn to handle tough problems while treating people with dignity and respect why it s so hard no matter how long youâ ve been in the professional world youâ ve probably seen ample opportunities for difficult conversations the overbearing boss the colleague who never meets a deadline the client who insists on getting more than what was agreed upon in the contract as much as youâ d love to gloss over those issues opens in a new window you know itâ s in the best interest of your career to advocate for yourself and confront the situation head on at the same time no one relishes the idea of having a difficult conversation you worry about what youâ re going to say how youâ ll be perceived and what the final outcome of the confrontation will be in short somethingâ s at risk opinions vary and emotions are a big factor if thatâ s not enough roy lubit md phd a forensic psychiatrist based in new york observes opens in a new window â œsomehow we are supposed to be experts on dealing with other people and with our own emotions even though these issues were never formally addressed in our education and training â think about it when do we ever really learn the complex nuances of having difficult conversations and dealing with delicate situations in the workplace hint usually we donâ t how to start the good news is with some simple steps and practice you can get much more comfortable with the idea of speaking up for yourself here are the basic steps i taught margaret about having a conversation with her manager and how you can apply them to your situation as well remember that advocating for yourself means being assertive not aggressive you can start the process by calling a meeting with the person in question in margaretâ s case she made a simple request to her boss â œtanner iâ d like to get some time on your calendar to discuss how weâ re working together what would be a good time for you â when youâ re sharing what you need in a difficult conversation stay calm focused and unemotional opens in a new window throughout the meeting youâ ll want to focus the conversation on what you need rather than casting blame or criticizing others to start identify the facts and impact of the situation and summarize them in a few succinct statements for example â œiâ m not always made aware of decisions or commitments made in staff meetings since i need that information to design solutions for my customers that puts me at risk of not meeting customer needsâ and an adverse rating from customers could really hurt the department â then identify specifically what you need to happen to address that situation â œi really need the information about programs and pricing thatâ s covered in the staff meetings â if there are multiple issues prioritize a list of the most important and start at the top to ensure that your requests are understood finish the conversation with questions like â œbased on the current situation and what we need to do to be successful what can we do to make this happen â this will engage the other party and help problem solve rather than block conversation with objections opens in a new window if you try these basics and find that nothing has changed itâ s worth checking to see if your hr or training team offers courses

escape from eastern ukraine,sloviansk ukraine â as you drive into the outskirts of sloviansk a small town of just around deep in eastern ukraine it becomes clear that the countryâ s crisis is reaching new levels i have spent the last week traveling across the region with another british journalist and on saturday as we approach the city the first thing we see is a checkpoint manned by pro russia militia mingling with police blocking the road a bus filled with men dressed in combat fatigues is parked on a grass verge nearby it is clear that these people are now in control of who enters or leaves the city further down the road we hit another checkpoint where a group of men flag us down demanding to know what why we are coming to sloviansk on outskirts of slaviansk opens in a new window pro russia opens in a new window have erected a russian flag on a road sign ukraine opens in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â david patrikarakos dpatrikarakos april opens in a new window as we talk i notice a russian flag that has been erected on a road sign and ask to take a picture of it a couple of the men eager to show it in the best light climb up the sign to straighten it there is pride in russia here i ask about the police at the first checkpoint the police are with us says the groupâ s leader a middle aged man dressed in combat gear with a peaked cap they are the people too he starts laughing do you like our bus he says and points up the road militia on outskirts slaviansk opens in a new window laughing pointing at bus up the road filled with militia do u like our bus pic twitter com opens in a new window â david patrikarakos dpatrikarakos april opens in a new window i ve become familiar with the increasing lawlessness of the region having already visited the cities of luhansk and donetsk where pro russia separatists have stormed and occupied government buildings demanding the right to hold referendums that would allow them to join the russian federation east ukraine is close to the russian border and russian is almost universally spoken here moscowâ s influence permeates everything from the architecture to the food ukraine has staggered from one crisis to another since the euromaidan revolution that deposed president viktor yanukovych in february yanukovych â a donetsk man seen as a kremlin puppet by the euromaidan activists was more popular in the east where the revolution is reviled among many with pro russia leanings the people here told me repeatedly that the kiev government treats them with contempt and wants to eradicate the speaking of russian in ukraine anger and paranoia combined with grinding economic depression is everywhere violence was inevitable russian president vladimir putin annexed the ukrainian region of crimea two months ago and the ukrainian government not without good reason fears further russian incursions onto its territory or at the very least russian meddling moscow has proven adept at stirring unrest amongst ukraineâ s pro russian population in crimea and the many protests i have seen in the area contain organized elements that suggest more than merely a simultaneous outpouring of disaffection sloviansk is a bleak industrial city of concrete buildings and grey streets that are broken up by threadbare patches of grass only few people are out walking hunched over in the falling rain the occupied police station is in the city centre and we manage to tag onto a group of protesters passing through the makeshift barricades that surround it and go inside masked and armed men everywhere in occupied police station in sloviansk opens in a new window ukraine opens in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â david patrikarakos dpatrikarakos april opens in a new

machine guns and in full military dress stalk the area around the police station their uniforms are unmarked but they are clearly professional soldiers and are obviously in charge here many bark

barricades at occupied police station in sloviansk opens in a new window ukraine opens in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â david patrikarakos dpatrikarakos april opens in a new window speakers are whipping the crowd into further excitement and its roars grow louder the people we speak to all reiterate their desire for a referendum and their contempt for the government and for the euromaidan revolution but it is clear nothing more is happening so we make our way out after a meal in a local restaurant my friend tries to get back inside but is refused itâ s for your own safety a guard tells him the boys get a bit rowdy at night sunday morning things are calm but tense everyone now expects the imminent arrival of troops from kiev and the area around the barricades is thronged with armed men conferring amongst themselves and shouting to each other across the streets whole city of sloviansk opens in a new window is just waiting for conflict ukraine opens in a new window â david patrikarakos dpatrikarakos april opens in a new window reports are coming in that government forces have arrived but no one seems to know anything the barricades are built up even more the afternoon brings sporadic gunfire sounds around the city and it s clear that conflict has arrived in sloviansk but i have more pressing problems for various reasons i have had to part from my russian speaking friend and am now alone in the city and unable to speak the language which under the present conditions is less than ideal no trains are running and a taxi carrying a foreign man will never make it through the many checkpoints around the city the only thing i can think is to call to my brother in the u s his girlfriend is american ukrainian and her father lived and worked in ukraine for years where he had dealings with the military the message quickly comes back that he can arrange to get me out i tell him i donâ t have much money and he says not to worry â the people who will do it are his friends he tells me to sit tight and wait which i do a couple of hours later i get a phone call from andriy he is he explains a major in the ukrainian army in kiev he will get me out he says but it will have to be done covertly if ukrainian army soldiers are discovered here they will be taken captive or worse killed the message is the same sit tight he tells me i am sending men to get you give me your address half an hour later there is a knock at my door and three men dressed in the ukrainian working class style â thick jumpers jeans and leather jackets are standing outside they tell me to pack quickly the plan andriy tells me on another call is that the men will take me past the inner city checkpoints at which point we will switch cars and a different set of people will get through the far more dangerous checkpoints that control access in and out of sloviansk as we leave the hotel ukraine where i have been staying just streets from the occupied police station i ask anatoly the guy who speaks the best english of the three what the plan is now we drink cognac is his surreal answer iâ m sorry i reply sure enough we immediately cross the street to buy a bottle of cognac before congregating around a nearby park bench to drink it and rather incongruously it seems to me though itâ s a custom out here eat chocolate in the distance i hear machine gun fire i take this opportunity to ask anatoly where our car is we get taxi he replies while i digest this further piece of alarming information i ask anatoly where he is from and rather surprisingly he tells me that he is from kramatorsk a nearby town but he continues with a wink i have spent some time in kiev we walk through the city streets onto a main road where several ancient lada taxis are parked up on the pavement anatoly begins gesticulating and talking loudly to one of the drivers sweating and raging while he tries to convince him to take us through the city checkpoints and unbelievably haggles over the price anatoly can tell i am getting frustrated donâ t worry be happy he says before laughing hysterically at his own joke agreement is reached with the taxi driver and the four of us pile into the beaten up car and drive through sloviansk negotiating the barricades that span the road at various points throughout the city centre we reach the main city checkpoint and anatoly gets out to talk to the armed militia manning it they are soon laughing at his jokes and for the first time iâ m grateful for his bluff good nature once through the checkpoint iâ m told that itâ s time to get out and walk to the meet point where they will hand me over to the next car itâ s women who are coming says anatoly four men in a car is not good only women can get you past those checkpoints anatoly is in good spirits as we wait for the car on the corner of a junction where several militia have gathered clutching bats and sticks see him he says pointing to one of his friends he is gay before collapsing with laughter once more no that was joke he continues anatoly wants to drink more cognac but i tell him that now is not the time he looks crestfallen after about fifteen minutes a black car with two blonde women in it pulls up i say goodbye to anatoly and the others and we set off as we approach the first checkpoint the women smile and wave at the armed guards who usher us through with barely a second glance at every checkpoint i have previously crossed in eastern ukraine i have been stopped and interrogated the phone rings and the driver passes me the phone my name is colonel valeri dobogyrsky of the ukrainian army in kiev city says the voice at the other end these women are my officers everything will be fine we pass through another two checkpoints with similar ease and i am on the road to donetsk airport and to safety back in kiev itâ s another world elegant ukrainian girls walk past designer shops while cafes blare out jessie j but the talk of war is everywhere in maidan square in the city centre the scene of the revolution that ousted yanukovych the pro ukrainian militia are still camped out in tents many of them believe they will soon be fighting again editors note some names have been changed to protect sources,1

thinking big i think a lot of people are drawn to startups because they are smaller more intimate companies where you get to know the people around you for example i went to olin college which only has students recreating the small team interactions i had at college were part of the reason a small company appealed to me pocket gems was smaller than my previous company but they had a strong focus on software engineering i knew that pocket gems engineering focus meant that even with fewer people the group would be more my style gaming is sexy before joining pocket gems i was working at the space technology company blue origin developing space technology was an amazing opportunity for an amateur space geek and was great for my inner child pocket gems still managed to pull me in because letâ s face it games are sexy i saw pocket gems as an opportunity to make games that would touch millions of people pocket gems was also a place where i could grow and learn as a software engineer in ways i couldnâ t yet imagine i started at pocket gems in january as the first android engineer when i started i was mainly writing java today i m the lead engineer on the android platform coordinating across multiple engineering teams horsing around in the two plus years since i ve been at pocket gems it s gotten bigger but you wouldn t know it from the way the office acts youâ ll still find people playing pool or ping pong after lunch people can still be caught aiming a nerf gun at the window while waiting for code to compile or for excel to get itâ s act together but the company is also older and wiser weâ ve learned a lot about what goes into hit games and what doesnâ t we have better tools and more options for designers and engineers alike we now spend more time investing in our teamâ s growth ensuring both the company and its individuals are always evolving constant challenges pocket gems is never stale i don t think anyone here is still doing the exact same job they were when they first walked in the door if you want to learn and grow pocket gems has plenty of ways to help you do that i ve worked on the android versions of over a dozen different games in two years and each project has itâ s own life whether itâ s a hit game or not it s always interesting all projects are all different some are easy some are exciting most are challenging team pride my favorite projects have had challenging engineering dragons that could take a week to slay every launch is another trophy the final result of months of challenges and successes every launch is a reminder of the experiences our scrappy android team has had together today pocket gems has employees amy stepanovich opens in a new window coyote logistics opens in a new window credit amy stepanovich my first job i was in college when i received my offer from coyote so i had never had a â œreal worldâ job but i was so excited about coyote because of the opportunity to learn about the logistics industry and be a part of a company that had huge aspirations to become an industry giant i loved that intensity and wanted to be a part of it a winding path working at a small company was a great way to dive into my career and my career path at coyote has evolved this is a huge perk of starting at a company when it is very young and growing really fast you either go where you are needed or you propose an opportunity that didn t exist before i loved this especially early on in my career at coyote because i really didn t know what i wanted i was able to learn a lot about the industry from many different roles and it gave me the opportunity to figure out what i wanted for my career i started in operations then i moved into a sales trainer role and from there i joined the recruiting team now i am back to my roots in an operations management role it is amazing to have the experience i have had and i am very grateful excitement ahead the best thing about working at coyote and what keeps me going

good way because you are confronted with new challenges and experiences and knowledge it keeps you on your toes and it keeps you wanting to be a part of something bigger than yourself today coyote logistics has employees young chun blom opens in a new window kayak opens in a new window credit young chun blom moving to kayak i was working at jumptap a small mobile advertising company i joined kayak because a really good friend of mine worked there and convinced me to come join kayak was exciting because of the people i just love the people and the fact that the product was travel excited me more one of my passions is traveling jumping around i worked on the hotels product for the first three years as director of product management and moved onto android for a year and a half then back to hotels again getting bigger the company has grown and i can t recognize everyone anymore more processes are in place and releases have become more complicated with coordination with international

jennifer lin better together the team has grown fast in the time i ve been at flipboard partly because of the acquisition of zite itâ s really cool to see how fast weâ re becoming one team and learning from each other working across departments passion and collaboration everyone works together and we listen to everyoneâ s ideas regardless of your role for instance even the data team that iâ m part of is involved with design for instance we all care about creating an amazing experience for our readers wearing many hats flipboardâ s mission to recreate the magazine reading experience on digital platforms and make the content discovery on the internet easier and more personalized plus i love working at smaller companies because i can wear different hats and doing different tasks and grow my knowledge in different areas today flipboard has employees charlie harrington opens in a new window knewton opens in a new window credit charlie harrington destined for a startup before knewton i was an investment banker at morgan stanley in college i always thought i was headed for law school but then i joined this student run company called the corp opens in a new window and plans changed the corp is awesome itâ s entirely owned and run by georgetown undergrads and profits are donated back to students via scholarships and grants you can start as a grocery store cashier or coffee grinder and work your way up to ceo or cfo within three or four years the corp is where i first became interested in business and decided that the logical next step was to work at a place like morgan stanley banking taught me a mere history major all about spreadsheets and markets and valuation and all these other things i had never really encountered before it was intense and challenging and i felt for a while like i was at the center of something important but i missed the day to day operations of running and growing a business and i wanted to work at a smaller scrappier company again i started looking for opportunities at new york tech companies and knewton stood out as a startup building something that could be really transformative knewton seemed like a great place for me to learn from and contribute to a team working on an important problem how to deliver personalized learning to students and teachers around the world redefining success i think thereâ s this feeling among some people in my generation that the next five years are always the most critical make or break years for our careers when i decided to leave morgan stanley i felt like i was jumping off this train headed towards some notional definition of success and that i might not be able to get back on the train if i didnâ t like what i found out there in the wilderness i had to realize that i was after different goals and that working at a startup where i could be learning something new every day along with a small smart as hell team was the best next step for me now it wasnâ t exactly easy to find something that fit my profile a non technical finance guy history major startup job seeker but i didnâ t let that stop me i still remember watching this knewton hack day video from my cubicle at morgan stanley around a m i knew i had to work there if i could get them to take me moving up the chain i joined knewton as a business development analyst but really i was there to do just about anything i was asked hereâ s a good example of an early project our ceo and founder jose ferreira was scheduled to speak at the davos world economic forum and he asked me to create a chart illustrating the history of education since the time of socrates as time went on and our api developed further i focused more time on business development researching and speaking to publishers about using our api in their digital learning products and then negotiating partnership contracts with them two and half years after joining knewton iâ m now jointly running our business development team and reporting directly to our ceo even more unexpectedly iâ m heading up our first international office based in london i definitely did not see that one coming iâ d never even been to europe before last year but it goes along with that same theme of jumping at every opportunity to learn more and contribute a couple key lessons learned along the way business development deals take take time to cultivate attitude matters plans will change and things will go wrong and you need to be okay with that and taking risks like joining a startup can have unexpectedly awesome results like opening an international office for one of the world s leading ed tech companies being a knerd well we call ourselves knerds so that probably speaks for itself iâ ve definitely let my geek flag fly since joining knewton i can state with pride that i ve been to at least two star trek the next generation dvd release parties at this point learning from colleagues is perhaps the best part of the knewton culture we ve got ph d s former k teachers and astrophysicists at knewton all willing to take the time to teach someone like me more about their area of focus and expertise during my first two months at knewton i spent a lot of time talking to people and i was always surprised by how much time and energy they were willing to offer to help me understand knewton and their roles iâ ve now realized thatâ s just the knewton culture and thatâ s why we re focusing on maintaining that culture as we expand to london we ve brought over a team of five from nyc to help seed our european hq with that same enthusiasm for teaching and learning today knewton has employees joe amadea opens in a new window blue jeans network opens in a new window credit joe amadea growing sales before working at blue jeans

sitting in front of a computer and toiling on the same old task everyday i get to tackle exciting challenges at blue jeans as we re building a new territory versus farming existing businesses with only other sales representatives i have the opportunity to contribute my strategic and outside of box thinking to my team and make an impact on the company more importantly i come to work every day feeling valued and that what i am doing is significant go team team work is not a cliche at blue jeans after every win no matter how big or small the deal is we celebrate as a team regardless of your position everyone supports each other here at the end of the day we all aim to move the company in a positive direction so it doesn t matter who is taking these steps we often say that the company culture is like a pair of jeans because you can t live without each other and it s versatile and casual this isnâ t just a marketing gimmick itâ s true cross department collaboration the best things about blue jeans are the collaboration support and strong relationships we have with each other and each department itâ s not the type of environment where you see people in the halls and wonder what they do in addition what keeps me going is celebrating milestone after milestone with each other itâ s been amazing joining a company in the early stages and watching it expand from the inside out i definitely look forward to celebrating more successes and continuing to grow my career at blue jeans today blue jeans has employees rebecca taras opens in a new window opens in a new window credit

about sinking my teeth into the solid task of being the chicago voice for such a fun and inspiring brand also i was always an avid reader of so it was logical to want to work for a brand that i looked up on the daily work hard play hard everyone in this company works extremely hard yet everyone also knows how to have fun too it s the talent creativity and can do attitudes that make such a success

opportunity with a smaller company for about a year and was hitting brick wall after brick wall i had big company experience on my resume but i graduated from suny buffalo and never did consider myself to fit the classic definition of an academic it seemed that all the roles i applied for were filtering for an impressive educational pedigree quite honestly i had developed a bit of an inferiority complex during the job search process and had an underdog mentality by the time i made it through to the interview process with mediamath my persistence had finally paid off and i was motivated by the opportunity to prove to myself that i fit in with really smart people doing bleeding edge work at a world class level and to learn from them i remember leaving my interview with a sense of nervous excitement i had prepared well and felt comfortable and confident instantly i nailed it everyone i had met with was incredibly smart driven and fit the tech startup prototype with an ivy league pedigree yet they didn t seem to care that i didnâ t when i got the job offer a few days later it was incredibly validating and i knew that this was an opportunity i d have to be out of my mind to pass up innovation excitement i had spent three and a half years at a third party ad server that was a small technology arm of a big public digital media company the technology was for the most part in maintenance mode i felt stifled uninspired and as though no one was really interested in innovating everyone at mediamath had high energy seemed truly excited about what they were working on and more importantly about their ideas which turned into products that were changing an industry i did my research on the founders the company and the people i d be working with and was blown away at the prospect of not only working alongside and learning from the top visionaries in ad tech but also getting in on the ground floor seizing the day i ve gone from being the lone sales engineer at the company to helping to kick start our emea operations with two of our co founders erich wasserman and greg williams to now managing three teams of solutions developers sales engineers and data analysts itâ s been a wild ride and iâ ve taken some big steps in my career learning not only how to build out and manage teams but also how to seize every single opportunity that presents itself at a company growing at warp speed even if it is outside of your job description mediamath culture is genuine respectful dedicated proud collaborative innovative accountable empowering we truly own our careers here and are empowered to influence the organization by identifying opportunities and priorities we hire very strongly on culture fit and every person from the top down is simply intelligent good natured and down to earth so down to earth that the ceo will even refuse to take the first class seat that a brand new sales engineer somehow got on the flight back from minneapolis while he gets shuffled back to his middle seat in economy yes even if you ask multiple times throughout the flight thanks joe with great power comes great responsibility so we work hard but we also like to have fun to celebrate our accomplishments there are regular trivia nights happy hours and team outings iâ ve also made some incredible friends here the kind of friends that will go to great lengths to wrap your entire desk and all of its contents in disney princess wrapping paper for your birthday a lot of us hang out on the weekends and spend time outside of the office going to concerts playing sports and even taking vacations together today mediamath has employees peter macdonald opens in a new window ideo opens in a new window credit peter macdonald redesigning the role when i started at ideo i

satisfaction inherent in creating design solutions today my role starts much further upstream in the process usually leading a project team i participate in in context design research synthesize findings identify unmet needs and opportunities for our clients and create strategic road maps for addressing those opportunities ideally i get to follow through creating concepts to populate the strategic road map and grow the clientâ s offerings the whole enchilada just as my role as evolved the company and our design process has evolved to fit the much greater scope and diversity in the kinds of work we do when i joined ideo most of company was made up of engineers and industrial designers today we have people from many disciplines including interaction design food science behavioral economics design research and communication design the broadening of our capabilities means that not only can we design a product but we can also design the digital interface the service it is part of the business that delivers it and finally the brand which sets the stage client interaction has become much greater than ever as we work together with them as partners and collaborators often projects include teaching client teams how to work like we do and even mentor them as they adopt our approach to innovation in their organization all these aspects align with our shared desire to achieve ever more broad and deep impact in the world through design positive synergy ideoâ s culture is about people working together with a shared commitment to excellence in their work and in supporting each other through collaboration and the sharing of ideas tools and experience an atmosphere of trust in each otherâ s capabilities and commitment means that we can focus our energy and attention on doing the right thing delivering the best we can within the time and budget available most people at ideo are over achievers who love to challenge themselves to stretch and experiment that spirit is infectious gently pushing everyone to try new ways to work evolving and growing our process being open the best thing about working at ideo is the constant stimulation and learning driven by the broad variety of challenges we take on the daily interaction with colleagues with diverse backgrounds strengths and passions and the pervasive openness to acting on new ideas early and often today ideo has

launching the u s dev ecosystem i got the chance to help build the developer community from scratch three years later we have hundreds of apps using our platform and a community of developers that

us since then too the culture has changed for the better with more a more diverse range of people joining the company who give us insight into building the best music platform the main thing that has stayed the same is the commitment to quality which has only gotten richer over the years i ve noticed swedish influence i love that spotify started a swedish company the swedes have a concept called lagom which is a mentality that means to focus on doing exactly what s needed and doing it well rather than doing unnecessary things we work hard but have an equal amount of fun to balance it out today spotify has employees,1

exposes a problem with open source but it s not what you think,a week after the heartbleed openssl vulnerability wreaked havoc across the web the conversation is shifting from reaction to reflection the discussion is no longer about what to do now but what can be done to prevent another heartbleed from happening in the future in other words we re entering the blame game chapter in this saga so who is to blame for heartbleed if openssl the software package at the root of the vulnerability were a piece of commercial software we could blame the company behind the app in fact when apple released an emergency patch for its own ssl tls bug back in february the company was scrutinized by security experts programmers and pundits a like but openssl isn t a commercial program it s an open source project maintained by a small group of committers and volunteers because openssl is open source there isn t an immediate figure or organization to blame are we really going to blame unpaid software engineers who commit to a project that of the internet uses for free so if you can t blame an entity the first recourse for some is the model of open source software itself to blame linus s law didn t fail over the last years open source software has developed a reputation for being secure and reliable open source code can actually be more reliable than proprietary or closed source code because there are more users looking at it to find bugs and security holes in eric s raymond s seminal essay on open source the cathedral and the bazaar he defines linus s law opens in a new window named for the father of the linux kernel linus torvalds which states that given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow in other words if enough users are looking at the code bugs and problems will be found raymond argues that this distinction is one of the reasons that open source software is inherently safer than proprietary code after all it has more people looking at it capable of finding and repairing bugs in the wake of heartbleed and other open source security failures opens in a new window some have questioned whether linus s law still holds true the argument is that if this was a commercially backed project with a well funded development team of full time professionals rather than the volunteers and committers that currently make up openssl the coding process and auditing process would have better but we can t know that apple s ssl tls bug which was much smaller than the heartbleed bug in both scope and in threat existed for more than a year before apple engineers found the bug and released patches yes that library was also open source but it was maintained by apple employees and apple had to approve any outside contributions i summarized my thoughts on what heartbleed means for open source on twitter last week heartbleed is no more an indictment of open source than apple s ssl bug is an indictment of closed systems shit happens period â christina warren film girl april opens in a new window although i disagree with raymond that open source is inherently more secure than other types of code i agree with him that heartbleed does not refute linus law opens in a new window yes the heartbleed bug went unidentified for more than two years but it was caught and caught by two different parties because the code was open heartbleed is not a failure of open source at least not the way you may think there is absolutely no reason to believe that heartbleed happened because it was an open source project powered by volunteers but if heartbleed doesn t refute linus s law that doesn t mean that this situation still doesn t put the spotlight on what really can hamper an open source project lack of resources open source one of the hallmarks of open source software in fact a big part of its appeal is that it is free to use and modify open source software isn t always free as in beer as free software foundation leader and gnu opens in a new window founder richard stallman likes to say but more often than not companies don t have to pay anything to access or implement open source code into their projects in fact it s this free aspect that has led to the mass adoption of open source in various industries although proprietary software or software that is a mix of proprietary and open source still dominates many industries open source has really found its place on the web microsoft might be the world s largest software maker but most web servers don t run windows they run linux and a web server application such as apache or nginx why because microsoft charges for its software for a small business running linux might translate into relatively small savings as a business grows however those savings can become quite substantial if facebook or google had to pay a license for every server or virtual server it operates and another license for its web server its business plan would be completely different this is even more true when open source software especially related to servers and security has a track record that is as good or better than proprietary solutions beyond that the great thing about open source is that anyone can take a project or part of a project and build something else on top of it and depending on the license those changes often have to be shared with everyone else that often leads to even better opens in a new window results but of course nothing is really free maintaining and supporting software open source or not has a cost major as in popular in size and in scope open source projects are generally funded in three ways donations from individuals volunteers by time or coding abilities and non profits the project is funded and steered by a commercial entity or entities corporations who use and benefit from the project hire employees who are dedicated to working on the project full time the debian linux distribution is funded by volunteers and by non profit donations it is one of the few completely community driven projects without a corporate sponsor ubuntu another linux distribution which is based on debian is sponsored by canonical volunteers still make up a big part of the project but canonical ensures that full time employees are paid red hat was one of the first companies to build a successful business off of open source and free software although it makes the source code for its projects available to everyone it sells software and service contracts for its flagship red hat enterprise linux and other products red hat also sponsors community projects such as fedora and centos companies including red hat and ibm also donate employees to work full time on important projects including the linux kernel the webkit project which is the basis for the safari browser and until google chrome is sponsored and maintained by apple over the last years most companies that benefit tremendously from open source including but not limited to amazon google facebook ibm cisco and twitter also give back code employee time and money to the projects that are most important to their business and product but not every project gets the type of attention or funding that it needs openssl used by many supported by few as the defacto ssl tls cryptographic stack on the web it might be easy to think that openssl has tons of support after all as we ve learned from heartbleed it s not just web servers that use openssl routers big expensive high end routers firewalls smartphones and other connected devices all use openssl if the number of people that relied on a project and its importance to the overall web was proportionally related to the amount of support a project has openssl would be well funded and have a heft of full time paid employees and maintainers it s not openssl a project that runs on of all web servers has just one full time employee one it gets worse in the five years since the openssl software foundation opens in a new window osf was created as a way to help sustain the openssl project this important project has never received more than million in gross revenue a year pure donations to the project are almost non existent steve marquess the openssl contributor who handles the business aspects of the osf addressed the current situation opens in a new window on his blog according to marquess the foundation typically gets just a year in donations marquess writes emphasis ours even if those donations continue to arrive at the same rate indefinitely they won t and even though every penny of those funds goes directly to openssl team members it is nowhere near enough to properly sustain the manpower levels needed to support such a complex and critical software product while openssl does belong to the people it is neither realistic nor appropriate to expect that a few hundred or even a few thousand individuals provide all the financial support the ones who should be contributing real resources are the commercial companies and governments who use openssl extensively and take it for granted the rest of the money that under million figure doesn t come from volunteered employees or corporate stewardship or even support contracts it comes from work for hire contracts that is companies pay members of the openssl team there are six core committers only one of which is able to make openssl his full time job an hour to work on a project related to openssl for that company even at an hour the fact that very few openssl team members exist which is partially due to the high skill requirements and lack of guaranteed income means that existing contract work is often unstaffed and thus unpaid so what s the solution well marquess would rather have openssl funded via support contracts in the footnotes he writes here s a plug for one of the most effective ways your corporation can not only support openssl but also receive something of tangible value in return a software support contract we have a formal contract with the fine print that lawyers love and your accounts payable people won t be all flummoxed at the bizarre notion of giving money away as they re used to paying for expensive commercial support contracts for proprietary software someday you may even encounter an issue with your mission critical use of openssl that could benefit from direct and prompt attention from the people who wrote that code he also makes mention of the fact that lots of big companies are already taking advantage of openssl in their commercial products and not contributing back i m looking at you fortune companies the ones who include openssl in your firewall appliance cloud financial security products that you sell for profit and or who use it to secure your internal infrastructure and communications the ones who don t have to fund an in house team of programmers to wrangle crypto code and who then nag us for free consulting services when you can t figure out how to use it the ones who have never lifted a finger to contribute to the open source community that gave you this gift you know who you are so what s the solution on hacker news opens in a new window some commenters criticized the osf s approach of doing contract work as a way to fund the project i think this is a fair assessment a project of the nature of openssl really should be funded by support contracts or by corporate sponsors agreeing to pay the salary of cryptography experts to work on openssl full time with no disrespect intended towards any member of the openssl team or the osf part of the problem also appears to be that the project lacks strong leadership at least in the way that could put a plan in motion to ensure that resources required to keep the project running successfully and not the part time gig for a few individuals and the full time job for one person are in place the osf itself could also do a better job being transparent about who its sponsors are and the nature of the projects it works on as well as doing larger calls for funding and support contracts having said that because this is not a commercial endeavor its unfair to hold the project to the same standard as we would a commercial entity maybe if companies can t donate employees to work on the code they can donate people to help with some of the public facing and fundraising aspects of the foundation i do hope that the largest companies that benefit from openssl especially those who use the software in their commercial hardware products and security consoles will see heartbleed as a wake up call not to abandon openssl and move to a paid solution but to do a better job giving back to the project and community more support could also mean more improvements to the code itself and to the whole process yes it s possible that even with a team of well paid engineers code auditors and support staff heartbleed could still have happened i would imagine finding this bug would be like trying to find a typo in ulysses the difference is that a better staffed project would mean that making changes and improvements to the code auditing and code review processes would be more feasible that makes for a better end product which means that everyone using openssl would have the advantages of a safer more stable and feature rich product heartbleed didn t happen because openssl is open source it happened because the project wasn t given the support it needed let s hope that changes and soon this project is too important to too many,1

rumsen direct to camera lead off a potential ad campaign pitch for accutron watches but ultimately freddy s speech marks the beginning of the end for amc s beloved and highly stylized period drama mad men mad men s seventh and final season picks up in january a handful of months following season six s finale that left don draper s personal and professional life in turmoil the partners at sc p informed don that he ll need to take a leave of absence from the company with no set return date following a slew of unprofessional incidents and don s marriage to megan continued to buckle under the weight of his self destructive ways climaxing with word that the couple s move to california would have to be cancelled even though megan had left her job in new york to start over in los angeles mad men s premiere does not offer us our whiskey drinking antihero until several scenes in instead opening with freddy in conversation with peggy olson over accutron penned by series creator matthew weiner and titled time zones the episode does not shy away from winking at its audience with allusions to the impending sunset of the series as freddy finishes his accutron speech for example peggy says in awe that s a home run actually it s kind of an end run with don on leave from the advertising company bob benson in detroit and ted chaough and pete campbell now based in los angeles it s still business as usual at sc p lou avery now occupies don s office and runs creative though he lacks the brilliance and finesse of don and routinely butts heads with peggy ken cosgrove eye patch and all is frustrated with his lack of mid level ad men to carry some of the workload and struggles with bob and pete s distance from the office without any underlings to handle meetings with clients ken barks at joan harris to cancel his meeting with butler shoes new head of marketing joan as we find out quickly takes matters into her own hands we finally rendezvous with don a few thousand miles away at lax to be precise megan picks don up from the airport for his short visit to los angeles whisking him away in a convertible though don canned the california move in the previous season we learn megan still went forward with her plans to transition to la and pursue her tv acting career a bicoastal marriage has since unfolded between megan and don though the distance between them takes shape beyond airline miles and time zones megan has delved into the angeleno artist lifestyle while don is still very much a madison avenue ad man albeit one with a complicated employment situation see also gaze into the dreamy eyes of don draper following a dinner with megan s rep megan and don return to her house situated high above los angeles in the hills megan though is too drunk to consummate his arrival in her city leaving don to sleep alone on the couch later don surprises megan by purchasing her a large tv where she can watch herself on megan snaps at don noting that the pricy television is embarrassing to have given how broke her fellow acting friends are in la nevertheless the two try to make their marriage work even though don confesses later in the episode that megan knows heâ s a â œterrible husband â as don visits la ted returns to new york for a quick trip to sc p conflict between peggy and ted has not been resolved instead melting into an awkward tension to recap ted professed his love to peggy and said he would leave his wife for her at the end of season six but got cold feet and begged don to let him be the one to move to california in order to get a nationâ s worth of space between him and peggy and save his family and marriage ted appears happy during his current trip to new york but peggy living alone in the city and apparently managing her apartment complex still harbors deep resentment toward ted instead of canceling kenâ s meeting with butler shoesâ head of marketing joan boldly decides to attend in his place and quickly learns that butler is aiming to exit sc p in order to establish an in house advertising department realizing that sheâ s in over her head when it comes to navigating such complex client waters joan turns to a business professor for advice on how to keep butler shoes as a client joanâ s interaction with both men the marketing chief and university professor showcases not only the sexism still present in but joanâ s tenacity when it comes to making herself essential to sc p though butlerâ s head of marketing the biz professor and even ken all underestimate joan she surprises all three with her business savvy even leading the butler exec to seek advice towards the end of the episode â œtell me what i should do â he asks joan pete is happier and tanner than heâ s ever been now that heâ s based in los angeles he and don grab a bite at canters deli before pete offers don a tour of sc pâ s petite but upscale la office he tells don about his apartment near the tar pits and introduces him to a young real estate agent who is helping pete shop for a house and dating pete evidently roger sterling we learn has fallen into a deep rut we reunite with roger in his bedroom early in the episode him naked and asleep on the floor next to several young naked hippies and the remainders of last nightâ s party he receives a call from his daughter margaret who suggests they get a bite to eat together to make amends during the brunch margaret tells her father that she forgives him for his â œtransgressionsâ and abandoning her mother and confesses she has done some soul searching to release anger and embrace love in her life roger bucks at margaretâ s new way of thinking even though he now associates with hippies that embody the free love movement of the â and â rogerâ s involvement with these hippies as it turns out is more due to use of substances rather than actual new age substance though he literally has more people in his bed than ever roger has little to hold onto in life now and doesnâ t fully process his daughterâ s words don flies back to new york on a redeye and finds himself seated next to a beautiful woman lee cabot played by neve campbell lee and don fall into conversation during the flight and she reveals her husband passed a year ago due to â œthirstâ alcoholism lee tells don her husband led a fast paced work life like don and was sent to the hospital by his company it is here that weiner offers us foreboding dialogue that resonates with both don and the viewer â œi thought he was really getting better then a doctor told me heâ d be dead in a year â lee says â œall of them would be â don confesses to lee that he feels â œlike a broken vesselâ at this stage in his life possibly a reference to a biblical psalm â œi am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel â before landing lee propositions don suggesting he continue to keep his transgressions from megan and go home with her after the flight don however turns down the offer and heads home to meet with freddy at donâ s apartment don we realize has been using freddy to pitch his ad ideas to sc p why don has continued to do covert work for the firm is not entirely clear though he is still being paid during his leave freddy reminds don how important it is to return to sc p soon in order to not be â œdamaged goodsâ and after all freddy would know since he once was told to take a leave of absence from the firm in order to get dry unbeknownst to peggy the accutron pitch was all donâ s this revelation exemplifies the strong connection between don and peggy though unaware of donâ s involvement peggy nevertheless champions donâ s ideas at sc p in her private life however peggyâ s loneliness is wearing on her as her brother in law gerry leaves her apartment peggy questions whether he should go all the way back to brooklyn at such a late hour â œi donâ t like anita alone in the houseâ at night gerry says as he departs thereby leaving peggy alone in her apartment after gerry exits peggy breaks down in her apartment sobbing by herself the season premiere ends with don deciding to not drink before sleeping alone in his apartment he tries to close his balconyâ s sliding glass doors but theyâ re jammed open letting in a cold january draft frustrated don surrenders to the weather slides open the doors and goes outside he sits in the cold night air shivering violently in little more than a robe and boxers no woman no alcohol to comfort him weiner does not deprive â œmad menâ fans of the historical and literary references that his show has become known for in this season premiere while megan sleeps next to him in la don watches s â œlost horizonâ on the new television pages of text appear on screen â œin these days of wars and rumors of wars havenâ t you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security where living was not a struggle but a lasting delight of course you have so has every man since time began always the same dream sometimes he calls it utopia sometimes the fountain of youth sometimes merely â that little chicken farm â â the â œlost horizonâ quote underscores one of the fundamental conflicts that has traced its way throughout â œmad menâ sâ series run how does one discover a sense of satisfaction with life when â œhaving it allâ is not enough but more symbolic is nixonâ s inaugural speech which don watches while polishing his shoes before freddyâ s arrival â œwe are caught in war wanting peace â nixon says â œwe are torn by division wanting unity we see around us empty lives wanting fulfillment we see tasks that need doing waiting for hands to do them â this nixon bit almost perfectly summarizes the challenges that â œmad menâ sâ characters face during the showâ s concluding season marriages are divided by space and differences sc p is fragmented in various offices and lacks cohesion families are split up and ultimately our leads including don peggy roger and joan are still seeking emotional

russia use cyberwarfare to further destabilize ukraine,eastern ukraine is full of rioters ready to separate from their nation s government in kiev at least that s the message the russian government may want to project to the world and analysts believe the kremlin could use cyberattacks to create more chaos and support its objectives protesters in eastern ukraine have clashed with police and stormed government buildings a group of separatists who took over a building in donetsk declared a people s republic of donetsk and demanded a referendum for independence on may in luhansk rebels raided an armory and took hostages but u s secretary of state john kerry has accused russian special agents of inciting the ruckus others claim there s a russian hand at play behind the curtain of what seems like a looming crisis manufactured either as pretext for a russian invasion or as a means to distract from the kremlin s annexation of crimea key to all this chaos is a sense of confusion about the state of ukraine the theory goes the kremlin has led the narrative that there is a widespread separatist movement in the eastern part of the country that the government in kiev cannot control and experts think the russian government could up its game with a subtle cyber strategy â œthe majority of stuff youâ re going to see is how can they deny access to information or make sure people donâ t know whatâ s going on â ben fitzgerald director of the technology and national security program at the center for a new american security told mashable â œclearly the russians are trying to control a specific narrative that narrative is one in which the kremlin would invade to protect native russian speakers the same reason it gave for invading crimea the russian government wouldn t necessarily need computerized espionage to support an invasion of eastern ukraine all things considered its takeover of crimea went off without much of a hitch and no one reported any electronic assaults that caused lasting damage russia s approach to eastern ukraine might come from precisely the same playbook but if moscow did engage in a significant high tech assault of any kind it wouldn t be the first time it has done so when russia invaded neighboring georgia in cyberwarfare was a main piece of its strategy and there it was true warfare state sponsored russian hackers hit georgian government websites with distributed denial of service attacks ddos that essentially erased the georgian government s presence online it was devastating but obvious i think those attacks would probably be too overt and also donâ t fit into the russian narrative of trying to protect ukraine or protecting russian speaking citizens in ukraine fitzgerald said this time experts say the russian government would probably be more covert sure washington might say russia is behind any information disruption but the kremlin could counter by saying the disarray comes from third party hackers it can t control and there s likely no way the u s could prove otherwise attribution is really hard said jen weedon a manager of threat intelligence at fireeye a global network security company itâ s not as easy as just identifying the origin of where an ip address is later she added itâ s certainly not an easy task to identify where an attack or an intrusion is coming from without substantial insight and we may have already seen the russian government testing the cyberwar waters during its takeover of crimea even if there were no blatant attacks a pro russian group of ukrainians known as cyber berkut claimed to have disabled the phones of ukrainian officials opens in a new window in early march right around when russia first entered the peninsula and they took credit for some attacks on government websites as well there s no evidence opens in a new window this disruption was coordinated by the russian government but the kremlin is also known to outsource its online dirty work opens in a new window suspicions out of kiev and the west along with denials from the russian government can lead to a finger pointing bonanza where facts are hard to decipher even so analysts say a moscow led electronic espionage campaign would have identifiable goals that if accomplished could look like the work of more than a band of online outlaws for example a kremlin led cyber squad might try to cut off internal ukrainian government communications so officials there would not be able to coordinate a response to russian disruption efforts weedon said officials in kiev would have difficulty passing information between one another which might make them seem incompetent the russian government could also disrupt lines of communication in eastern ukraine and mess with television and online news in such a way that eastern ukrainians are exposed only to information propagated by the kremlin this would all be a part of a strategy that only the russian government could coordinate and it would do three things for moscow first it would allow the kremlin to further the narrative that it wants to protect native russian speakers second it would prevent the ukrainian government from countering that narrative with real information third kiev s inability to respond would make it look weak disorganized and incapable of assisting an eastern ukraine that is floundering and all this feeds into what experts believe is a larger plan to create a sense of confusion among eastern ukrainians â œthe fascinating thing i think about this is itâ s old school military doctrine with updated tools fitzgerald said that old school kremlin doctrine goes as follows create chaos then intervene in a way that makes russia look like the white knight small online and electronic assaults are a means to an end for the russian government weedon said and its goal is to manipulate public perception in a way that allows it to play the hero the situations described above are all plausible according to experts but they haven t happened and even if they did these experts are quick to point out that this would qualify more as espionage than cyberwar it s also important to remember that cyberwar is just that it takes place online and electronically and therefore has limitations an army can only do so much without a physical force to back up its online operation russian troops are massed at the eastern ukrainian border but they have not crossed that line you could certainly destabilize a state in terms of causing chaos targeting critical infrastructure disrupting communications spreading false information said peter singer director of the center for century security and intelligence at the brookings institution but thatâ s not the same as taking over the state for that you need physical force on the ground,0

flight in with a second following in last september spacex also successfully demonstrated the ability to relight a falcon booster s first stage opens in a new window and slow its descent back to earth monday s planned reusable rocket test will attempt to take that demonstration a step further we ve been doing improvements to the recovery of the first stage in little steps being very careful it doesn t affect the performance of dragon koenigsmann said nasa space station program manager mike suffredini told reporters on april that once he was convinced spacex s falcon landing legs posed no threat to dragon s cargo delivery to the station he was eager to see how the test would unfold on monday spacex s road to reusability developing a completely reusable rocket technology opens in a new window has been a long range goal for spacex ceo elon musk as a way to reduce the cost of spaceflight in musk unveiled a plan for reusable rockets that envisioned spacex booster stages capable of flying back to landing pads on their own as well as dragon space capsules with the ability to touch down on land spacex dragons currently splash down in the ocean reusable rockets could substantially cut the costs of spaceflight according to musk spacex s standard falcon rocket launches cost between million and million according to the company s website but the cost of the fuel and oxygen and so forth is only about musk said in when he first unveiled spacex s reusable rocket opens in a new window program so obviously if we can reuse the rocket say a thousand times then that would make the capital cost of the rocket for launch only about spacex is still a ways off from returning a falcon rocket to a landing pad on dry land in march musk wrote in a twitter post that the company will aim for water splashdowns until it can master the challenges of returning a rocket booster to earth safely to that end spacex has conducted a series of vertical launch and landing tests of its grasshopper reusable rocket prototype sending the prototype rocket on ever higher flights over the company s proving grounds in mcgregor texas those tests concluded in december more test flights planned on march of this year spacex test fired its first reusable rocket opens in a new window a larger vehicle to continue reusable rocket research where the grasshopper flights left off those test flights will eventually be launched from spaceport america in new mexico spacex officials have said the testing program is the next step towards reusability following completion of the grasshopper program last year spacex officials wrote in a video description of the static engine test test flights in new mexico will allow us to test at higher altitudes than we are permitted for at our test site in texas to do more with unpowered guidance and to prove out landing cases that are more flight like koenigsmann said spacex opens in a new window will take a step by step approach to its reusable rocket demonstrations with actual falcon rockets while the company aims to make a land landing by the end of each test will be dependent on the success and lessons from the previous flight in the meantime spacex is scouting for possible rocket landing zones,1

un climate report what you need to know,on sunday the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc released the final installment of a massive report laying out just how feasible it is for the global community to limit manmade global warming to below dangerous levels like the previous two installments published in september of last year and march this report contains extremely dense technical material yet its contents are hugely important for the public and policymakers it lays out the case for why drastic emissions cuts are needed starting within the next decade in order to have a decent chance of limiting the amount and the pace of global warming first here s the good news from the report meeting the target of keeping global warming to less than degrees fahrenheit above preindustrial levels can be done if we take action now here s a breakdown of some of the latest report s most important findings the window of opportunity to avert a dangerous amount of global warming is rapidly closing we have just about a decade left to bend the upward curve of greenhouse gas emissions attempts to reduce emissions significantly so far have not succeeded pathways of global ghg emissions yr in baseline and mitigation scenarios for different long term concentration levels credit ipcc opens in a new window â œclear message from science to avoid dangerous interference with climate system we need to move away from business as usual â â wmo omm wmonews april opens in a new window the longer we wait the fewer options we will have after for example many of the more than policy scenarios the scientists examined would not succeed in limiting manmade global warming to degrees fahrenheit or less which is the goal that world leaders agreed to opens in a new window during the copenhagen climate summit in in other words the world will have fewer options available the longer we wait to cut emissions we re definitely on the wrong track the world is on course to see an increase in global average surface temperatures of up to degrees fahrenheit by the end of this century this could have disastrous consequences by dramatically raising global sea levels melting land based ice sheets and leading to more heat waves and extreme precipitation events among other impacts we are already seeing climate change impacts worldwide including the increased likelihood and severity of some extreme weather events like heat waves and heavy precipitation events and the global average surface temperature has increased by just degrees fahrenheit since ipcc opens in a new window climatesolutions opens in a new window press conf emissions have grown over past decade despite mitigation efforts and economic crisis â ipcc ipcc ch april opens in a new window we already have most of the technologies we need we don t need to in fact we shouldn t wait for some miracle technological solution to climate change since tools to burn energy more cleanly and use energy more efficiently already exist however in most climate scenarios carbon capture and storage technology needs to be employed to bring emissions to lower levels such technology which would capture carbon dioxide emissions before it escapes a power plant and bury it deep underground is not yet proven on a commercial scale emisions cuts may not break the bank although economic studies of how much it will cost to minimize global warming vary but the study says that aggressive emissions cuts would only shave off between and from consumption growth during the century emissions need to trend in the opposite direction asap total manmade greenhouse gas emissions were the highest in human history from to and reached gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in the vast majority of that or about has come from burning fossil fuels for energy with smaller amounts coming from deforestation agriculture and other sources to have a good chance of limiting warming to less than degrees fahrenheit compared to pre industrial levels carbon dioxide levels would have to be kept below parts per million ppm by they are currently just above ppm this would require emissions cuts of to by and near zero emissions by accomplishing this without paying an exorbitant cost would require that actions begin within the next decade coal is reversing energy sector gains while coal use is plummeting in the u s the increased use of coal in developing countries much of it shipped from the u s as a cheap source of electricity has reversed trends toward a progressively less carbon intensive energy sector business as usual is not climate as usual atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are currently just above parts per million ppm and are already the highest in at least the past years under a business as usual scenario the report says carbon can be expected to soar to higher than ppm by this could lead to global warming ranging from degrees fahrenheit to degrees fahrenheit above pre industrial levels by the end of this century when the full range of scientific uncertainty is taken into account total manmade greenhouse gas emissions yr by economic sectors the emissions data from agriculture forestry and other land use afolu includes land based emissions from forest fires peat fires and peat decay credit we re on a binge about half of all cumulative manmade carbon dioxide emissions between and happened during the past years since carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for as many as years the cumulative emissions are what determines how much warming weâ re ultimately in store for and weâ ve already burned about half of the carbon budget that would keep warming to less than degrees fahrenheit if those in favor of acting to limit climate change feel vindicated by the report that s not the same as feeling optimistic preventing dangerous climate change may be technically feasible but the political will to take the hard and necessary decisions by the time we have to take them still seems to be lacking,0

phone review cortana leads a feature packed update,windows phone has come a long way microsoft s phone platform has enjoyed a lot of critical success over the past few years but the praise was mostly for things like design cool tricks like live tiles and the fact that it s not made by apple or google even when windows phone received kudos it was usually in an attaboy kind of way a backhanded compliment that subtly hinted the truth that for all its pizzazz the operating system was in some ways months or even years behind its chief competitors ios and android no longer with windows phone which gets distributed to developers today with the first handsets coming in a couple of weeks the software on windows handsets has caught up with its rivals in a few use cases microsoft even offers a better experience the condition of windows phone s app catalog remains a big asterisk though many popular ios and android apps don t have a windows phone version and some of those that have taken the leap don t offer all the features of their counterparts nonetheless users and developers can approach that platform with a new confidence windows phone delivers the great user experience the platform is known for but with far fewer man this phone would be great if only it couldâ moments than previous generations the upgrades in windows phone generally fall into three main buckets new features better personalization and cortana the platform s newborn virtual assistant cortana the most scene stealing new feature in windows phone is cortana a voice powered virtual assistant named after master chief s holographic helper in the halo video games while functionally similar to apple s siri cortana is more than just voice her goal is to serve you better by learning from your behavior anticipating your needs and offering you information when it makes sense credit microsoft she does this by examining not just how you use your phone but also with hooks into your personal information like your bing and facebook profiles all opt in of course because anything that has access to our bing history would really know a lot about us right in all seriousness it s a great idea but one that takes time to really work in my brief time with cortana i didn t get so much as a hint of her anticipatory abilities although i look forward to the birthday gift suggestions for my brother come july i did however get a sense of cortana s ability to learn the first time i asked cortana to text my wife her contact card popped up along with every person in my address book who shared her first name after i told her the correct one on every subsequent command whether it was a text or something else all i had to do was say her first name and cortana knew who i was talking about that was great but cortana doesn t always get the hint after pinning mashable to my phone s home screen i asked her to launch mashable dutifully cortana asked whether i wanted to open the website or my mashable email account i told her the site and i did so the next times i uttered the same command but she never figured out to just stop asking and go right to the site this problem gets worse if the app in question lets you pin things to the start screen evernote for example lets you pin individual notes to start so every time i asked cortana to launch evernote she asked me which one one was the actual app another my to do list but cortana saw them both as the app with the same name credit microsoft cortana was fantastic at performing typical voice assistant stuff like creating calendar appointments emailing contacts and setting reminders i particularly liked the people reminders where you can attach a reminder to a specific contact rather than a time or place remind me to tell andrea i have two tickets to rocky next time i talk to her cortana also negates the need to download shazam since she can listen for music and tell you what s playing just as well she ll even save your search to refer to it later after spending some quality time with cortana i m intrigued i definitely get the sense that she s more capable than siri but it s hard to say how much is mere potential at this point i d love to see her integrated into more parts of the experience i find it odd that she can t search the windows phone store for example i want to believe cortana might after months of continual use evolve into an indispensable tool the framework is there but based on what i saw that s going to take some retraining personalization in ios apple introduced a vip list feature so users can designate contacts that matter the most to them windows phone now has the same functionality with inner circle a list of people who will be able to reach you even if you ve set the phone to quiet hours another new feature that s similar to do not disturb in ios microsoft hasn t just learned some feature tricks from apple though with version windows phone adds icloud to its list of compatible accounts something even android phones usually don t offer now if you have family members or important contacts on ios your windows phone will be able to integrate things like calendars seamlessly the calendar app itself is upgraded as well when you re in the week view tapping on a day expands it with some pretty nifty animation tapping the day s header or the back button takes you back to the week view microsoft s really outdone itself with the ui it s much better than iphone or anything on android credit microsoft one of my favorite aesthetic upgrades in version is the start screen background image when you first set up your windows phone you usually pick a theme color which then dominates the start screen s live tiles that don t have their own color now instead of a color you can choose for those tiles to all share the same image as you scroll up and down your start screen the image doesn t move as fast as the scoll so the tiles feel like a window to the picture in the background trust me the effect is pretty cool credit microsoft new features one of the biggest holes in windows phone s feature lineup was some kind of notification center the software could handle push notifications of course it just didn t have a central hub for them now it s got one in the form of action center which you access by sliding from the top of the start screen besides providing a place to see your most recent notifications action center also includes some quick settings there are controls for wi fi bluetooth airplane mode and screen rotation lock but those are just the defaults you can substitute whatever settings you wish for the four buttons a nice touch of customization credit microsoft action center is well thought out for instance when you dismiss one of the notifications by swiping right the app s live tile reflects the change after all if i ve already seen the email here i don t need the tile screaming at me to check back that s very logical and something i d like to see ios get better at microsoft changed the built in onscreen keyboard in windows phone to a word flow keyboard which is essentially swype the idea is you input text by swiping through letters without actually tapping the screen you still can but since you don t need to lift fingers anymore you may be able to save some time i ve never been that good with swype so i was skeptical of new feature but i found that the big key design of windows phone s keyboard makes all the difference while i was often unsure of what to do with my other hand the word flow keyboard was great for dashing off short notes quickly you need a couple of days to get confident with it but once you do you ll wish it was there on every phone you use credit microsoft there are a host of other minor upgrades including the ability to upgrade a voice call to a skype call vpn support and a reading mode in internet explorer but the best one may be wi fi sense this feature lets you skip any agreement screens when joining public wi fi networks which can sometimes interfere with access even better you ll be able to share network access to any contact without sharing a network s password the downside said contact needs to be using wi fi sense too going to windows phone isn t just another software update with it the platform is technologically closer to its rivals than its ever been although some deficits like bluetooth low energy support are still nagging with cortana microsoft is even venturing into parts unknown in the hope of creating something really forward looking for today though windows phone is a phenomenal smartphone experience in many ways superior to ios and android it s a shame then that the ecosystem is still challenged with issues surrounding app selection and app quality instagram on windows phone for example is a shadow of its iphone version,1

rise and fall of aim the breakthrough aol never wanted,when we think about the spectacular collapses of once untouchable internet properties companies like myspace and pets com come to mind the rise and fall of aol instant messenger rivals them all once the dominant force in digital messaging and a source of innovations other companies spun off into billions of dollars of businesses aim is now mostly dormant mashable sat down with three of the early engineers of the program to learn about its origins why aol never quite embraced the concept of a free messaging service getting hacked by microsoft and the features that never quite made it to users the belonged to america online it had risen above competitors in prodigy and compuserve to become the dominant internet service provider for american households millions of subscribers paid aol monthly for the ability to sign online its disks could be found almost anywhere the you ve got mail notification became the sound americans associated with their first email accounts as well as a movie with tom hanks and meg ryan barry appelman eric bosco and jerry harris worked at aol in the and early as engineers on aol instant messenger known commonly as aim they weren t hired to build a messenger appelman and bosco programmed in the unix operating system harris had been a programmer at a small web browser company purchased by aol but together with a group of other engineers they helped take aim from inception to dominance then watched it fall into dormancy unable to convince aol management that free was the future sitting with them and talking about the program they exude pride for what they built and how it impacted the internet that pride is accompanied by a sense of what if during our conversation the term innovator s dilemma is thrown around a few times harvard business school professor clayton christensen coined the term which is the title of his renowned book opens in a new window the concept is simple companies concerned with its current products profits and customers often fail to recognize and adapt to change even from within whatsapp is not far from their minds that comes up a couple times as well the app which facebook bought for billion is essentially what they worked on in the mid messaging over the internet aol is still pivoting away from its days as an isp under the leadership of tim armstrong it now focuses on video and its ad network in another life before a disastrous acquisition of time warner it brought the internet into the homes of americans and controlled the program that popularized online messaging without ever really meaning to it would be easier to call aim ahead of its time if it had not become so wildly popular almost immediately after its launch in many ways aim was right in line with the times just at a company hanging on to a business model that would soon become obsolete credit bob al greene the buddy list the seeds of aim began within aol and the mind of barry appelman appelman joined after his time at ibm where he worked on some of the first standards to connect computers over the internet through what are known as transmission control protocol internet protocol or tcp ip before building a messaging program for the internet he created something else that would eventually spawn aim necessity being the mother of invention helped lead to what is now a near given on the web the buddy list appelman remembers it was november aol still charged an hourly fee to be logged onto its service with most systems of that era an administrator might be able to tell people were logged on but they didn t know who they didn t have any central presence information appelman said they didn t know anything about not so for aol due to the way its system was constructed aol knew not just that people were logged on but which users they were this allowed for the construction of a location tool that proved extremely popular at first aol users who logged on were not greeted with a list of fellow friends online but aol did have a manual way to search for said friends if you knew their exact screennames this function became so overrun with requests that its servers often crashed appelman reasoned that instead of having to ask the program might as well tell you if your friends were online patent us opens in a new window user definable on line co user lists was born a k a the buddy list it was an ease of use improvement you didn t have to check whether somebody was on but it told you appelman said far from a giant development product appelman discussed it with only his close colleagues as aol did not have a great amount of oversight at the time buddy list was done without telling anybody because we didn t have any product management then so i just decided to do it appelman said diagrams from the patent that barry appelman holds for the buddy list credit screenshot google they wanted to kill it eric bosco joined aol in august two months later aol would switch from an hourly rate to a flat fee people could suddenly spend as long as they liked online aolâ s infrastructure had trouble handling the transition every single server in production was crashing because of the load bosco said bosco bugged his boss to put him on a project he joined a team that unbeknownst to aol executives had begun to explore the idea of a messenger that existed beyond the garden walls of aol a small group of us basically four spent three weeks in a room trying to design what the system would look like bosco below said credit aol had become a behemoth in the early days of the consumer internet it handled around simultaneous connections bosco said the goals for aol s messenger were set much higher million simultaneous users even that number would eventually be much too small that requirement meant aol s messenger would need its own code particularly as the resources allotted to the project technically none would have trouble with that scale aim was being developed without any approval from aol executives but if aim was to be a standalone program it needed to run off some equipment aim was sort of the prototypical skunkworks project bosco said â œsince it was an unsanctioned project one of the problems we had was you need to run servers in the data centers â appelman called in a favor to the head of aol s data centers who happened to have some old hewlett packard servers he d planned to ship back to hp he agreed to lose the machines so the aim team could use them in an unofficial capacity so during the day i was writing code and at night i was configuring the servers bosco said when the program was finally shown to aol management was not pleased offering a piece of aol s system for free to everyone went against the company s entire subscription based model they wanted to kill it and at some point they wanted to fire me for doing this stunt appelman said appelman credits a particularly strong push from the product team for final approval to launch the product the company quietly released aol instant messenger known commonly as aim in may credit bob al greene talk is cheap aim s launch saw zero fanfare the engineers and product team had to fight against executives who recognized no value perhaps even a losing proposition in offering a free program aim was unceremoniously put on one of the company s file transfer protocols ftp a common way for files to be moved from one computer to another over the internet while public aol s ftp was not meant to be a consumer facing platform but aol s popularity had made its ftps closely watched among those in the know aol was the core of the consumer internet and every hacker in the world was trying to bring aol down so they knew all of our ftp server addresses bosco said without even a webpage from which to download aim the program spread rapidly the very first night of the release of aim we put the binary executable on the ftp server that night we got simultaneous users bosco said people found it people located it people spread the word harris below said people would camp on that ftp server waiting for the update which came weekly credit early success did little to convince aol management that a free product was of any good to the company bosco who was eventually promoted to a management position and still worked on aim had to fight to keep it afloat my biggest job as a manager was to keep aim alive internally because every single executive vice president wanted to shut it down and kill it they could not understand the concept of giving away for free something that was of real value to the paying subscriber base bosco said it was always aim versus aol they hated us aol might have had its issues with aim but that did little to hamper the program s rapid growth one particular use case the engineers identified was in workplaces aol was a consumer focused company and we realized early on that one of the main constituents of people that was going to use aim was going to be consumers in the workplace bosco said and most likely the workplace would not be amused some clever programming within aim made the program the bane of it departments one feature automatically probed for a way to connect if its primary port was blocked aim would run through all the available ports until it found one that was not this made aim extremely hard for companies to thwart bosco recounted a call during which the head of it of a major investment bank screamed at him the administrator had tried to block aim but the program had eventually hopped around until it had attached to something the company couldn t risk interrupting the port that synchronized time across the entire company s computer system his only choice to block us was to un synchronize time on all of his computers bosco said the admins had no clue how to block us we were like malware from their point of view the program blossomed drawing as many as million simultaneous users professionals flocked to it aim became how all wall street communicated appelman said credit aim high aim quickly became the dominant messaging program of the late and early aol bought another messaging company mirabilis which operated icq another popular messenger the popularity of messaging meant other companies began to approach aol about a way to tap into aim apple s first iteration of ichat was powered by aim microsoft also got in the game with msn messenger while it found a solid user base overseas it lagged aol opens in a new window in attracting u s users microsoft wanted to ensure its msn program at least allowed for contact with aim users thus msn messenger launched with the ability to chat with aim accounts opens in a new window this meant war we were not amused bosco said so we were like well we ve got to try blocking them so they can t do this any time another messenger connected with aim s network it was required to provide a version type msn messenger identified itself as msn messenger version bosco said so they tweaked aim s system to cut the connection any time this version tried to connect microsoft countered it released an update to its msn messenger program that self identified as aim aol blocked the attempt again after more microsoft updates that attempted to connect to aim aol threatened to introduce malicious code into msn s system checkmate aol had triumphed microsoft eventually signed a deal with yahoo opens in a new window to connect messaging networks credit jerry

kari ziegler front row sitting andy evans bala nair lu lu young the features aim was originally designed to exist entirely apart from aol but early on in the development process the engineers realized it would need to be able to communicate inside aol s program as well aim became a bridge between the so called walled garden and the wider internet that garden provided aol users with a buffer aol was able to control much of what its users saw and was intentionally designed to be family and particularly child friendly aim was a window outside the walls where aol had no control this tension between what aol could control and aim s breach of that security haunted the project from the early days and led to the creation and suppression of some of the program s most innovative features one of the first was the warning feature harris said in order to allow to happen we had to develop a feature he said we had to allow people on both aol and aim to warn somebody and if you warn somebody a number of times the connection got slower and slower until they were cut off for a certain amount of time like with any part of aim the warning feature became a battle between the engineers and the rest of aol the warning feature internally was called electronic vilification and we wanted to label the button evil bosco said the aol corporate marketing team absolutely refused to let us label the button evil other features evolved as the engineers sought to solve shortcomings they d encountered while using the program bosco recounted times he would message a coworker with an urgent question and wait for a reply was the person there and just not answering had he stepped away when would he be back enter the away message it was almost a corporate need bosco said with no shortage of feature ideas and a history of operating below the radar the engineers at aol often updated aim without going through the company s bureaucracy though buddy icons launched without approval harris said if we could sneak stuff in without telling the product people it would get in appelman said the aim profile which eventually grew to include a variety of its own features came out of the fact that the aim website was out of the control of the engineers they had no say in what went on the page which they recount was usually a big download button they had ideas to make it a social landing page for its users where people could have a profile access message boards and generally drive aim s popularity back to the web that idea was roundly rejected the only recourse we had was to bake some of the functionality into the client itself bosco said it would have made a lot more sense to put your profile on a webpage rather than a client that nobody else could see but we were not allowed to do it credit aim added elements that appeared years ahead of other companies it rolled out voice chat before skype it added file transfer it launched chat bots people could interact with as well as a stock ticker and a news ticker the engineers also began exploring the mobile space just as text messaging was beginning to catch on aim introduced the ability to chat with mobile phones but with aim bringing essentially zero revenue and costing money to operate aol did little to encourage the exploration of the features and outright blocked others numerous ideas never made it past the development phase the engineers explored ways to broaden aim s user base creating versions for set top boxes and playstation that were never released aol squashed those appelman said another feature that never made it to users was internally known as aimster after napster took off aolâ s engineers figured out a way to make a userâ s files searchable a buddy could check out the files of a friend and select ones to transfer it was not as functional as napster but aim had many more users we thought with our network it would spread like wildfire he said by that time aol had merged with time warner which was not a fan of napster aol killed the feature credit bob al greene ghosttown usa despite the wild success of aim and the innovations it spawned aol kept it at armâ s length aol at the time was a subscription business intent on maintaining its revenue as an internet service provider it did not help that attempts to monetize aim were unsuccessful bosco worked on putting ads into the program despite a variety of tricks to increase the impact of its ad space including determining when a person stopped typing so the ad could change with maximum impact advertisers never bought in aim was not compatible with doubleclick the dominant ad management service of the time despite the effort bosco said they never sold a dollar of ad space and instead just ran aol promos to a subscription business a free program that could not be monetized was worthless aol was not about to change its entire business model for aim aim was never really embraced by aol because of the innovator s dilemma what i call the cash cow dilemma appelman said image from wim s investor reception in the summer of barry is chatting with one of the founders of sql vision a wim portfolio company credit aim did eventually begin to bring in money but not in significant amounts its grip on the messaging market had loosened and the rise of social networking sites with proprietary chat functions made it less relevant the program had also begun to lag behind other services aol shunned outside developers that wanted to create their own features for aim its own innovations had helped keep it on the cutting edge but it began to fall behind as other services opened up aol s resistance was palpable when bosco and some colleagues released an open source messenger for linux the company was furious aol was very much anti open source bosco said with aim s popularity waning the operation s staff which had ballooned to around at its peak was repeatedly cut back layoffs started in and continued yearly through in a round of layoffs left the program with only support staff bosco harris and appelman have moved into advertising at choicestream opens in a new window which works on highly targeted programmatic marketing campaigns aim still functions the way a ghost town silently weathers on aol declined to provide numbers on active users for this story but a report said aim held a share opens in a new window of the world messenger market aol is doing reasonably well despite the missed opportunities it is now the leading video ad server opens in a new window on the web and is working to compete with major players on internet advertising looking back appelman bosco and harris each voiced his own sense of what if but ultimately acknowledged aim came to fruition in the wrong company at the right time if aol had hindsight maybe the story would have had a different ending appelman said they couldn t make that leap where they turned the business upside down companies generally don t do that trick,1

boston terror will never destroy a runner s high,when i ran my first boston marathon in i was stunned by the aura most marathon crowds pack a part of the course and disappear for the out of the way stretches but the boston crowd was at least three deep nearly the entire time everyone picked out something about the runners outfits your singlet the color of your shorts and shouted words of encouragement drunk college kids from every school in the city lined the course and hollered as only drunk college kids can it s hard to forget that kind of uproarious positivity thatâ s why the boston marathon is so special an optimism normally derided as hokey or fake is open and encouraged there for many that marathon is the culmination of an achievement that took years to build to which contributed to why last year s bombing at the finish line that injured at least opens in a new window and killed three was so vile lives were ended and shattered and it felt like the two suspected bombers had totally marred the positivity on which the boston marathon thrives during that race it was amazing that there could be such a raucous party for a running event and it wasnâ t until years later that i realized the crowd knew something i didnâ t completing a marathon is worth celebrating people start running for all sorts of reasons sometimes each step provides a modicum of control in an otherwise hectic life other times itâ s the easiest way a person knows to lose weight maybe itâ s just simply that for as long as someone is running he s removed from his phone and email but every catalyst is for the good of that individual not everyone who runs likes doing so but there s always some sort of satisfaction there that kind of inherent positivity has a way of building on itself if a person feels good after one run thereâ s a good chance he ll lace up again and again until he s running road races filled with people who are there for the same reason because running provides some sort of solace because it gives them goals and a means to accomplish them participants in a cross country charity relay that began in march in california cross the finish line of the boston marathon in boston sunday april credit michael dwyer ap images that understanding is like an energy at the boston marathon that washes from shouting spectators onto runners and flows among competitors itâ s almost like a party rather than a race getting to boston was the hard part and for many that marathon is like a long victory lap the boston marathon is the culmination of thousands of runners personal goals watching tens of thousands of dreams come true within the span of a few hours is nothing short of incredible so when those two bombs ripped across the finish line last year there was something especially obscene about the expressions of awe twisting into faces of shock seeing tears of sadness where tears of happiness should have been whether they meant to or not the suspected bombers tried to deface a monument to human accomplishment they tried to permanently alter the memory of the marathon to leave an ugly asterisk alongside the goals people accomplish there to etch a black mark onto something previously unblemished a mark that would forever undermine the future achievements of marathon runners would the boston marathon ever be the same that worry sprouted in my gut and slowly wound its way through my body itâ s painful to watch something pure reckon with the darker side of the world so many wonderful memories are tied to that event but ever since last year a new nightmarish memory often seems to take over the narrative of the marathon marathons are defined by moments in which the runner wants to quit random muscle spasms unexpected back pain the sudden burning desire to stop running and devour a dozen pancakes all of these things can and often do happen during a mile run any can be enough to make a racer shut down yet the vast majority of people run walk or stumble across the finish line and in that simple act you can see the folly of the bombers actions dance teacher adrianne haslet davis lost a leg in the bombings but has already performed on stage before a crowd in the year since another victim rebekah gregory is awaiting her surgery but is starting a new life with her husband and son also survivors of the blast j p and paul norden both underwent leg amputations shortly after april and now they hope to start a roofing company opens in a new window see also the boston stories you must read today did the bombers really think they could kill people s sense of hope people when surrounded by optimism persevere and those who take part in the boston marathon are about as optimistic as they come theyâ re fulfilling a dream on april i will line up for my second boston marathon for the first time since i expect the mood to be a strange mix of somber joyous anxious and reflective but i also expect an aura of hope that hope i think will feel natural despite the shadow of last year how could it not thousands of dreams will be about to come to fruition bonus boston bombing a wedding and a recovery opens in a new window,0

am the monster get ready for games to evolve,okay you ve got a second head start my guide says in my ear his voice loud over my headphones i scramble forward in my new dark surroundings the woods around me echo with animal sounds as i look for food safety escape from what s coming sniffing the air the terrain around me springs to life as all the smaller creatures are illuminated i need to pursue hunt and kill them quickly so i can grow stronger my survival depends on evolving from them so i can take out the team of four pursuing me alone in the forest i must hunt to avoid being the hunted this is the surprisingly solitary line of thinking found in evolve the upcoming cooperative competitve shooter from games and turtle rock the latter is best known for its groundbreaking cooperative four player franchise left dead which puts a team of survivors against some of the most evil and creative zombies ever to grace video games a legacy like that leaves high expectations and the preview of evolve i played at pax east shows plenty of promise both for gamers who want to work together and for those who would rather don the lone wolf role a hunter tethers the goliath in evolve an upcoming title from games credit games turtle rock hunt run hide unlike every other character in the game the monster is viewed in third person a switch games executive producer denby grace confirmed was done later in development it s an important change as you really get the sense of the size of the world around you and how big and lurching you can become everything around the monster looks so small especially the team of hunters you fight so pulling the camera back gives a sense of power you wouldn t get if you just could see two huge claws in front of the camera for such a hulking beast the monster moves like a dream at least at the first level of evolution an important gameplay element is being able to scrabble over all types of terrain so you ll have to scale walls and jump away from foes quickly some of the fluid parkour like movements feel completely graceful it was easy to lose myself in running away your speed is the advantage so early as you are a lot weaker than your combined foes thus the early strategy for the monster involves hunting using its ability to sense prey to quickly take down other beasts as you eat you fill up your evolution meter and prepare for the next level while this match allowed me to play a monster called goliath there will be other monsters with different powers in the full game but of course you are constantly being chased by a team of four hunters each with very specific abilites to take down the monster the game only ends when you win or you die the biggest threat to the monster is the trapper that character can snare you with electric threads and pull you toward the group and also lay down a large electric force field to keep you from fleeing the area the monster should take them out first and likewise the group should protect him in my play experience the group left the trapper for dead and it lead to a much longer play time for me after i ate him the second biggest threat to the monster is the medic who provides support to the team via healing and a sniper rifle following that you ll want to take out the support and assault characters who are both able to deal massive damage to you adding stats to the monster during the match in evolve credit games turtle rock evolution all of this is secondary to your need for flesh because you re a giant bloodthirsty monster so eating was a priority even when i was running away getting to the second stage of evolution quickly changed the dynamic of the match once you evolve you immediately get to put skill points into slots you also get a huge health boost though you are temporarily a little more vulerarable until the process is over but heaven help the team of hunters once i was more powerful the dynamic of the match quickly changed to where i wanted to chase them along with basic melee attacks the monster is equipped with lots of ways to do damage you have two different types of jumps that allow you to close ground between you and a foe my favorite attack was the rock throw which could put a lot of hurt on a fleeing hunter or one that had taken to the air to avoid my swiping claws you do lose a great deal of speed and mobility after evolution which means changing strategies you won t be able to always outrun the group of hunters but you may not really want to while i was taken down before the final stage of evolution it was easy to see how it would progress a much more powerful but barely mobile monster has a very distinct play style and hopefully you ve taken out at least a couple members of the hunting party before reaching that level grace told me the game is built around catering to these different play styles gamers who love to work as a team and those that love to play by themselves the four hunters can t succeed unless they stick to their roles and the monster must be able to adapt to a number of situations there will be options for players to create matches based on whatever class they favor online or play offline against ai there s still a lot to learn about evolve we don t know the status of a campaign mode yet or anything really beyond the matches played at press demos and at pax but the game

to put mustang atop empire state building for anniversary,half a century ago before the internet and viral video stunts ford took one of its brand new mustang convertibles cut it into three pieces stuffed it into the empire state building s tiny elevator and sent it all the way up to the floor then the company reassembled the car and drove it around the the manhattan landmark s observation deck now to mark the mustang s anniversary and because ford apparently had so much fun the last time the automaker is doing it again of course ford is not chopping up a priceless old mustang instead the company is using one of its freshly minted models you can see them slicing and dicing it in the video above unveiled late last year the ford mustang is both a throwback with lines and curves reminiscent of the late mustang mach ii and an update as the front shows hints of the futuristic looking ford fusion with its slit like headlights a dst metal fabricator carefully measures and marks where the cuts will be made to section the ford mustang convertible that will be displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit ford motor co this time however ford and its partner in high rise crime dst industries opens in a new window had to cut the car up into even more pieces prakash patel ford s mustang program manager explained â œthe car is actually bigger longer and wider than what it was in remember the empire state building is exactly how is was years ago so we have a significant challenge â a dst metal fabricator slices through the rear section of the ford mustang convertible that will be displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit the elevators used to transport the car pieces nearly feet up are just inches wide in order to ensure that the trips go smoothly each segment rides alone dst built an empire state building elevator replica in its shop and carefully placed each piece inside it testing a dunnage for moving one of the rear quarter sections of the ford mustang convertible that will be displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit ford motor co the other goal was to ensure the ford mustang didn t end up looking like it was reconstituted from six separate pieces so dst also built a special subframe that goes underneath the mustang and bolts the body and suspension together dst metal fabricators prepare to fit the front subframe and suspension to the ford mustang convertible that will be displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit ford motor co once the observation deck closed to visitors on monday ford and dst had just five hours to move and reassemble the ford mustang before unveiling it atop the iconic empire state building on april it will remain on display until april mashable will be present at the event and will report on ford s handiwork the crew rides up in the elevator with parts of the ford mustang that will displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit ford motor co the crew that will build the ford mustang that will displayed on the empire state building observation deck credit ford motor co the crew loads one of the rear quarter sections of the ford mustang which will displayed on the empire state building observation deck into the final elevator required to get the car to the floor credit ford motor co years ago if you re curious about how ford did it the first time check out the following photos for a mini walk through the operation to tear down a whole and healthy mustang long into four major sections and many smaller pieces enters a critical stage the well trained team of specialists skillfully and cautiously separates two sections by unfastening clamps and sliding pipe rails apart on both sides of the car the technique of reducing the mustang into four sections proceeded so smoothly the job was successfully completed in about an hour credit ford motor co removed from the operating arena on street the front third of the disjointed mustang is precisely tucked into a waiting elevator to be whisked to the floor observation area the front and rear sections of the car were wheeled into the lobby in rickshaw fashion the sections and all the other pieces were carefully assembled and joined together again in a reverse operation on the floor more than feet above the street credit ford motor co once again restored to robust health and with the hazards of operation mustang safely concluded the convertible recuperates while perched on a corner of the floor parapet the car was later moved inside the building to the observation deck where it will be on public display to be viewed by thousands of visitors to the famed landmark until next spring it is the first car ever to be put on the observation deck and the biggest and heaviest object ever on display there credit ford motor co this latest ford stunt ends just before the start of the new york international auto show which kicks off on april and takes place at the jacob k javits convention center just a few blocks from the empire state building,1

treating introversion like a trend,i am guilty of blogging away my anger and tears after struggling to connect with other people i prefer staying at home or going to a quiet coffee shop over attending a loud party or nightclub i like reading knitting and netflix and i absolutely hate small talk yet i didn t discover i was an introvert through a quiz opens in a new window or by reviewing a list opens in a new window i found on my facebook news feed when i was a teenager i wasn t aware of introversion as a real thing most of the time it was commonly referred to as being anti social i had to discover this part of my personality and what it really means on my own one of the biggest frustrations among introverts is the advice doled out by so called experts to help introverts become more social a hot media trend of recent years i want to scream at them if it ain t broke don t fix it dr andrea letamendi is a clinical psychologist scientist and speaker she spoke with mashable about the definition of introverts and the many times inaccurate portrayals that surround them on the internet people do not fit into a binary system credit gemini dragon gifs the first step we must take in understanding introverts and extroverts for that matter is that no one really fits either type of the time think of it as continuum in that some people are low on the introversion scale and others are high and of course some of us are around the middle says dr letamendi most are actually ambiverts people drawn to both inner and outer experiences ultimately any label you slap on a person without knowing her is most likely incorrect introversion isn t a disorder credit thatsmypurseidontknowyou one of the most persistent problems facing introverts is the idea that they need to be fixed fear is a motivating factor behind this particular misconception and it s perpetuated by the hour news cycle in particular more often than not the term introvert is hastily applied to the sometimes uneasy quiet teens who end up on the evening news for committing heinous crimes against their classmates or themselves but these people are not typical introverts and their introversion was not the cause of the events that made them infamous most of the news coverage surrounding aurora colo shooter james holmes harps on the fact that he was quiet opens in a new window and shy the same words have been used over and over again to describe people who commit mass murder how does highlighting a person s introversion get to the real story of what s going on in his or her head it can t introversion is not a condition not a disorder and certainly not acknowledged in the psychiatric classification of disorders as a mental health problem explains dr letamendi adding that when people see something they can t understand at face value it s easy to suspect the worst of it in reality introverts are happy social people with a circle of friends whom they trust we may not always be social butterflies but that doesn t mean we want to stay locked away from the world in the same vein extroverts can also struggle with social anxiety and depression mental illness doesn t choose a particular personality mental health is just part of being a human using introversion as an excuse credit neeeephilim it is possible to be happy and outgoing while still being an introverted special snowflake however some people try to rationalize that they are introverted because they have social anxiety or they re anti social but this isn t introversion at all it s a misconception that people who are introverted dislike other people or find social interaction aversive or distressing it s also a misconception that introverts have deficits in social skills says dr letamendi so when a self proclaimed introvert says i hate people it s important to recognize this isn t introversion introverts love people we just dislike small talk introverts are more inclined to talk about deeper subject matters so we re probably more interested in a story from your childhood or a philosophy theory than the weather or what you ate for breakfast most introverts have great social skills we just need the right setting unfortunately introverts often struggle maintaining their relationships with their extroverted friends there are countless stories on the internet of people dumping their buddies because the latter didn t want to go party the resulting isolation often leads to depression and increased anxiety even for introverts who did not suffer before if an introvert is experiencing symptoms of depression low energy fatigue irritability and lack of interest in things a person would normally be interested in it s not because of introversion but it can be easy to get trapped in a cycle of isolation and not know which came first introversion doesn t make you a genius credit thismindisacircus if you look at tumblr introverts like to associate themselves with scholarly pursuits and nerd culture introversion as dr letamendi says is a stable personality trait therefore it cannot logically affect a person s aptitude as much as myself and my fellow introverts would all love this myth to be true in fact there are many extroverts who are just as smart and nerdy as introverts and not all introverts are geniuses by default though many introverts generally enjoy activities like reading and writing so how can we set aside our differences and just play nicely if we change the way we think and behave introverts and extroverts alike there may be hope for us yet introverts keep your me time but cut back on the internet credit thepetcollective if you need to be alone do it make your downtime pleasurable and use it to do your favorite activities it s important for an introvert to recharge so dump any negativity you might have seeking out support or social interaction is fine to a point however dr letamendi warns spending time on the internet is associated with perceived stronger social support and increased confidence but those benefits come with some costs when it comes to actual face to face encounters one temple university study for instance found that introverts who frequently used the internet reported less community involvement increased loneliness increased negative affect increased time pressure and decreased self esteem over the course of the study relative to introverts who rarely used it so all that time spent talking about being an introvert on reddit or tumblr might be hurting you more than you think extroverts try changing up your social schedule with your introvert friends once in a while credit your introvert friends love a good party now and then but they also just want to sit and have a cup of coffee with you why not change things up and plan some more introverted activities when your friend isn t feeling up to a big group sometimes she just wants to hang out one on one realize relationships are a two way street credit dewogong some introverts need understanding and patience but no one likes to be rejected all the time a common problem among introverts is that they like to be invited to the party even if they don t go often this situation ends with the introvert being dumped by their friends and feeling betrayed but this situation isn t necessarily fair to their extroverted friends either at some point the introvert should exert some effort and go to the party it s important to compromise give yourself something to do credit televandalist if you are at a party where you don t know many people or you just don t want to be your friend s shadow all night find a job feel like you can make it as a mixologist create some cocktails for the guests bartenders aren t just great at making drinks they also listen to people s stories or if you re more of an audiophile play dj for the night nothing brings people together like musical requests decompress credit wakethedogs find a quiet spot during the party to keep you from overloading it will make the gathering much more enjoyable and you ll feel less drained after all the social stimuli afterward take an hour for some quiet time at home to wind down and don t feel bad about it make a plan credit paakojsimpson introverts like to plan things if you are more of an extrovert perhaps dropping in unannounced or proposing spontaneous bar hopping isn t the most enjoyable activity for your introverted pal let him know what is happening so he can make a game plan where he s going when he can decompress and when he should call it a night is all very important whether you re an introvert or an extrovert your personality isn t something you can change to fit the fashion of the season introversion isn t a trend so stop treating it like it s trendy there s a lot more to it,1

as a result of the gaffe see also priceless twitter reactions to that nsfw us airways tweet it was an honest mistake matt miller a spokesperson for us airways told mashable it was done as part of the process to capture the tweet to flag it as inappropriate miller said unfortunately the link to the image was inadvertently included in a response to a customer in case you missed the internet these past hours yes it really was that ridiculous all too often in times like these granted there aren t too many examples on this level executives unfamiliar with this unruly turf scramble to contain uncontainable damage heads must roll they silently agree oftentimes blaming the something marketing rockstar who previously had been killing it with year over year growth on the company s high value social channels as a former something rockstar who killed it these are your words social media marketers not mine let me tell you why this move is always a mistake everyone usairways opens in a new window is about to fire ought to be promoted instead that was some real growth hackingâ mat honan mat april opens in a new window left to toil away in obscurity the world s social media managers are all too often nameless faceless and thankless to the millions who welcome their tweets into their everyday lives they spend their days staring deeply into various dashboards that were created to help them craft tweets schedule postings and monitor brand mentions engagement is the name of the game and it s all done selflessly for the good of the brand the dashboards which have names like sprinklr spreadfast tracx hootsuite socialq percolate brandwatch buffer socialflow sprout and argyle were all created under a range of promises but really help people do one thing use twitter com better than twitter com allows twitter you see was never created to be a customer service tool and yet that s just how the country s major airlines which some say opens in a new window shouldn t be on twitter at all are using it usairways opens in a new window if you fire that employee i will lead a global campaign to boycott your airline â rob delaney robdelaney april opens in a new window the website skift com conducted a timely analysis opens in a new window of the industry s use of twitter and found that us airways sends more than tweets per day all of which are replies and its average response time is minutes that s more than tweets per year that didn t contain the most offensive image ever sent by a major brand those are pretty good odds and yet there s that outlier us airways and american airlines use the software platform according to skift opens in a new window it s a proprietary tool that doesn t appear to be public facing snap is american airlinesâ proprietary social media tool and aaâ s team uses it for of its twitter activity in an effort to up its weak social game post merger us airways recently began tweeting with it too and it now represents of the sister airlineâ s activity american airâ s social media team declined to answer questions about snap but we know a few things about it from looking at other activity on skiftiq americanâ s response rate to customer issues is faster than any other airline minutes the airlineâ s activity is also devoted to replying to customers whatever snap specs are itâ s focus is on conversation and customer support still the incident illustrates the need for twitter to prove that it s serious in its play to welcome corporate dollars amid all the bieber fans and breaking news it needs to provide a better option to help brands safely navigate the real time landscape perhaps somehow keeping them away from that inadvertent trigger ever wanted a job in social media well start prepping your rã sumã and cover letter now because usairways opens in a new window is about to fire everyone â eliot olson leftcoastsuit april opens in a new window i asked mashable s senior tech analyst christina warren what that all means here s what she said twitter facebook instagram insert social platform here were never designed for businesses but rather for consumers even though businesses now use those tools extensively the products themselves haven t improved substantially to serve or users all management systems are in some ways a hack because they still provide limited functionality and accessibility compared to what you might get for a product designed for use by a large company twitter doesn t make it easy for multiple users to admin a brand account this case appears to be a pure copy pasta nightmare but think about all the accidental tweets brands have sent and the various security challenges that occur when tons of people need to access something twitter and facebook and their ilk obviously don t need to focus on building branded consoles and management tools that s best left to others for many reasons but that doesn t mean they can t work to make sure their apis and data streams are accessible and usable by those third parties so us airways management you made the right call by not firing your social media person he or she made a mistake that doesn t equate to doing a bad job overall the incident that collectively derailed our mondays should not be considered a fireable offense the unnamed social soldier was simply using whichever tool that corporate mandated and he or she goofed

reflection and resolve boston marks year since bombings,boston mass with the barricades along boylston street and grandstands rising above both sides of the finish line it was possible to at least for an innocent moment mistake tuesday for marathon monday opens in a new window also known as the boston marathon a joyful april day that is central to bostonâ s identity as a city of grit determination and camaraderie but there were too many signs of the dayâ s actual significance as the one year anniversary of the marathon bombings to linger in that carefree place for long the bombings that took place one year ago killed three spectators krystle campbell lu lingzi and martin richard the bombs wounded others and cost more than a dozen to lose some of their limbs people walk past the site of the second explosion after the ceremony commemorating the one year anniversary of the boston marathon bombing credit mashable on tuesday the crowds gathered in their usual spots as if it was the dress rehearsal for the marathon except one with completely different emotions than a typical race day people lined up behind barricades along boylston street just as they do on marathon monday and just as they did last year when boston s sense of safety and innocence was challenged the faces i saw on tuesday were somber nowhere more so than at the two bombing sites those sites marked by wreaths protected by honor guards from the military police and fire departments throughout the boston area were places where people paused to reflect and pray throughout the day some had visible injuries from the bombings sporting new limbs many more were grappling with invisible scars from mourning a loved one to coping with a newfound fear of crowds laurie laconte from beacon hill who stopped for a moment near the site of the second explosion said her daughter is dealing with the emotional repercussions of being very close to one of the explosions last year thereâ s so many horrible things that happened and visible things that happened to people but there is also a whole other level of people that experienced terror and theyâ re suffering too and the fact that my daughter is terrified of crowds i just think that it goes way way beyond what youâ re seeing and what youâ re seeing is bad enough â laconte said inside the forum restaurant which is located just behind the site of the second explosion the wait staff went about their day as usual they planned to donate proceeds from the dayâ s business to marathon bombing related charities but otherwise greeted the anniversary with a steely resolve sitting at the bar as the official marathon tribute ceremony took place down the street staff reluctantly turned up the television s volume at the request of several patrons the employees it seemed would have preferred to continue playing the mix of alternative rock music they had on than listen to more reminders of the bombings this makes sense considering that for them just showing up for work at their rebuilt restaurant opens in a new window is a daily reminder survivors some with new legs gathered at the marathon tribute ceremony at which several of those injured by the bombings gave powerful speeches of perseverance hope and friendship that nearly overshadowed speeches by former boston mayor thomas menino and vice president joe biden patrick downes who along with his new wife lost a leg in the blast opens in a new window expressed his thanks for the tight knit survivor community â œto our fellow survivor community â he said at the tribute ceremony â œwhat would we do without each other â every speaker echoed the slogan that emerged almost immediately after the attacks â œboston strong â one local television station wcvb tv even referred to its coverage of tuesdayâ s events as â œboston strong one year later as menino who was in office at the time of the bombings said at the tribute ceremony boston s devotion to marathon survivors and victims families will never waver even when the media spotlight is turned off â œwhatever you have to do to recover and carry on know the people of boston are right there by your side â he said carlos arredondo is seen walking down boylston st while the crowd applauds the cowboy hat wearing hero sprang into action when two bombs went off at the race last year dragging victims to safety credit christina ascani you are strong at this broken place menino told the crowd the heartbeat of boston is a mighty force after the ceremony participants trudged slowly and quietly down boylston street in a rainstorm past the two bombing sites to a flag raising ceremony at the finish line a bell tolled at p m et the time the bombs detonated and silence fell over the crowd leaving just the sounds of raindrops and rustling umbrellas to fill the void the emotions in boston are still raw one year later and i suspect they will remain so next week when thousands will once again line the streets to cheer runners across the marathon finish line in the wake of the bombings and especially on tuesday i have wondered what the boston strong slogan really means for awhile in the immediate aftermath it seemed to signify that boston is too strong of a city to cower in fear that the terrorists picked the wrong target as was so eloquently and efficiently expressed opens in a new window by red sox slugger david ortiz soon after the bombings it also seemed to refer to the city s unique character one which is vividly on display each time the marathon is run and thousands of strangers turn out to cheer on determined runners who struggle to climb heartbreak hill in newton mass there is a mixture of grit determination and camaraderie that binds boston together despite a network of roads that are impossible even for many locals to navigate a miserable winter climate that feels like it is assaulting you personally and sports teams that until recently went decades without winning the big game the marathon is quintessential boston an endurance event that rallies the city out of its winter induced coma marking the start of spring everyone who grows up in boston as i did has memories of marathon monday as a kid on the north shore i watched on television as elite runners and wheelchair athletes set records seemingly every year their feats of endurance chronicled by breathless sports commentators later like countless massachusetts residents before me i was a spectator along the marathon route when my older brother brett as well as a cousin and several friends ran the race to raise money for various causes that was the year my little brother russell held up a huge sign along the marathon route that said â œbrett someone already won the marathon â thatâ s vintage boston sarcasm for you bostonians mourned and reflected on tuesday and next monday they will reclaim the finish line from the fear that spread from these streets last year as vice president biden put it at the end

chic why fashion is holding off on wearables,after receiving an invitation for this yearâ s fifth annual fashion awards opens in a new window an event that acknowledges the fashion industryâ s savviest digital programs and technology outputs you can imagine my panic in selecting the perfect ensemble finding the perfect outfit i had nothing in my closet that remotely resembled anything technologically or digitally advanced unless you count my â œfollow me opens in a new window â tights or my twitter name necklace and i knew i showing up wearing my nike fuel bands opens in a new window yes plural or pebble watch and other gadgetry was just too understated for my aim at high fashion geek chic credit to say i was beyond gleeful would be a massive understatement and so it wasn t until i arrived at the event that i discovered that no one else shared my enthusiasm for technologically enhanced clothes literally why was i was the only one dressed up like a christmas tree this was the fashion awards right where s all the wearable tech the wearable technology category awarded nike fuel with the most fashionable wearable but i knew there had to be more well fashionable wearables that were left out why was that i wondered see also fresh apps for fashion enthusiasts why was it that the fashion industry consistently one that prides itself on being cutting edge seemed to be missing wearable technology i posed this question to margaux guerard opens in a new window co founder and president of memi opens in a new window who spoke with mashable about memiâ s stylish smart bracelet the bracelet is geared toward urban women who want to unplug but stay connected to important calls using a bluetooth enabled iphone application fashion is late to the game in wearable technology guerard said the industry has congratulated innovators in colors cuts and hemlines for so long that when it comes to technology there is slow adoption the jury is still out on wearables and have their brand reputation and customer loyalty to protect guerard knows a thing or two about the brand prospective having worked as the director of global marketing for diane von furstenberg opens in a new window before starting memi â œwhen i worked for dvf we spent a lot of time thinking about how we can protect and preserve the brand and thatâ s important because thatâ s how you create prestige and a premium brand â some people are doing it well we have seem some major players like rebecca minkoff opens in a new window creating the stelleâ audio clutch opens in a new window with a speaker system built in to one of her clutch bags this yearâ s announcement of tory burchâ s recent partnership with fitbit which will debut this fall as a collection of stylish bracelet and pedant accessories opens in a new window and intelâ s partnership with open ceremony to create a smart bracelet opens in a new window both which are seemingly driven by the technology companies rather than the fashion houses wrists necks and fingers are very valuable real estate guerard said and thatâ s a safe place for consumers to play because they can always take it off if itâ s not accepted by their environment there are some very innovative designers and technologists trying to blow the shirt off wearable technology with some racy designs like studio roosegaardeâ s intimacy dress opens in a new window that becomes transparent as the wearerâ s heartbeat increases but mainstream reactions seem to be landing that type of garment in a futuristic space odyssey fashion that theyâ re just not comfortable with yet yuli ziv opens in a new window founder of the fashion awards says sheâ s encouraging her community and attendees to think further into the future and plan for more innovations to keep up with whatâ s possible she says while it may be uncomfortable for consumers and even designers now that doesnâ t mean they shouldnâ t start planning more advanced applications of technology in their designs down the line an industry with a technologically bright future i believe this industry is just at the beginning of reaching its potential as something life changing and revolutionary there is no reason our clothes wonâ t be as functional and durable as some of the gadgets we covet ziv said if there is anything fashion brands can learn from the ipad itâ s the fact that even today consumers are willing to pay for a product that is well made and life changing and if people are willing to pay for a sexy gadget that does the same thing every desktop does theyâ ll be willing to pay that price for an innovative item of clothing theyâ ll wear for years regardless of seasons and trends and if brands canâ t see where this industry might be in the next or years getting the next fashion trend right wonâ t help them survive,0

donovan talks world cup dreams and that legendary goal,even the most casual american soccer fan knows about landon donovan and for good reason after all the man is generally regarded as the greatest soccer player the united states has ever produced the year old donovan has played so much soccer in fact that he took a self imposed three month hiatus from the game early last year to rest up and recharge before returning to the pitch just over a year go now the l a galaxy star says he s ready for the world cup which will be his fourth in brazil this summer but donovan who is also one of the centerpieces of this creative samsung campaign and the united states men s national team usmnt have a tough road in front of them they landed in the world cup s group of death alongside powerhouse germany hyper talented portugal and always tricky ghana which has eliminated the usmnt from the last two world cups this week with less than two months to go until the world cup kicks off on june donovan caught up with mashable to chat over the phone we talked about the usmnt s prospects in brazil the evolution of soccer stateside and worldwide the last minute goal he scored against algeria to push the u s through to the knockout stage of the world cup and much more what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation q a with landon donovan u s midfielder landon donovan reacts to a call against mexico during the second half of an international friendly soccer match wednesday april in glendale ariz the game ended in a draw credit rock scuteri mashable the group you guys landed in for this world cup certainly is daunting in many ways but what are the things you feel good about either advantages you might have on the field or off the pitch things that might work in your favor donovan how many teams get to play ghana portugal and germany in one world cup we re excited about the opportunity as daunting as it might seem it s a great opportunity we have a lot of guys that have been here before and understand what it takes and we have a few guys that are young and hungry for an opportunity they ve never had before it s going to be a great experience i think we re certainly capable of beating all those teams that doesn t mean it happens or it s easy but we re absolutely capable of it we feel like we have a very real chance let s scout the competition beyond group g who do you think are the favorites in brazil and who do you think could make a dark horse run well i certainly hope the u s in in there i think it would be hard to bet against brazil in a world cup in brazil there will be a lot of pressure on them but they re certainly good enough to win argentina is a very good team and germany too a team that some people talk about but not everyone knows about is belgium talent wise when you just look at their players i think they re as good as any team in the world you scored that incredible late goal against algeria to put the u s into the knockout stage in then videos of people reacting really went viral but no one else on earth can watch those reaction clips from the same perspective as you how did you first come across them and what was it like watching them for the first time i found out about the videos the very next morning that s the beauty of social media these days but honestly i just look at it the same way anyone else would i just look at it as a fan so it s fun for me being in the moment and watching the replay or reactions online are two completely different things in the moment it was all about just doing what i could to help the team win that s my job after it was about enjoying and appreciating the whole play coming together almost everyone was involved in it in one way or another it was the ultimate team goal it was such an incredible fan moment though people must bring it up to you all the time when they see you in public right people do have a lot of cool stories around it i was with my son or i was with my grandma who s since passed away just really cool stories it s fun to hear them all and understand that you affected people in that way julian green has been a hot topic among usmnt fans since the year old bayern munich player committed his international future to the u s over germany last month but very few people here have really seen him play you got a good look at him training for this month s friendly against mexico what does he do well and what does he need to improve on i think he has a good starting point he moves well and technically he s gifted he has good feet and some good pace so it seems like he s going to be a good player but i m a little cautious because we ve been a little fast to anoint good young players in this country when they come up so i d like to give him some time to develop that s for good and bad you can let him grow that way and if he doesn t pan out then you didn t build him up for no reason i hope he gets some games with bayern or wherever else he might end up but eventually it does seem like he ll be a very good player for the national team going forward fair or not though a lot of the questions many fans have are about what he might be able to add this summer do you think he can contribute to the team in brazil fortunately i don t have to make those decisions laughs but i did think he held his own in camp before the mexico match at some point what he needs is to just play in more games the only time you re going to tell if he s really capable is when he plays in more games at whatever level that is so i hope he gets to do that and keep improving you re lined up to play in your fourth world cup this summer have you thought one way or another about it being your last i haven t made any decision definitively but from a physical standpoint the game is so much faster now than it s ever been and one of my greatest attributes is my ability to run and my speed as you get older that sort of tails off it s not that i don t think i ll be capable but it might be more difficult at to keep moving the same way so we ll see i certainly haven t made any decisions yet it would certainly be difficult to do another one but not impossible usa s landon donovan left is chased by germany s bernd schneider right and thomas linke during the world cup quarterfinal soccer match between germany and usa at the munsu football stadium in ulsan south korea friday june credit tony gutierrez how have you seen soccer change or evolve as a sport since you ve been a pro and even going back to when you were a kid i think it s becoming more and more of a young man s game it s just so much faster and more dynamic than ever i think what you re going to see here soon is that you re going to have to start backing off a bit more in training because the games are so intense and demanding that you need a lot of the week just to recover ten or years ago you could train all week really hard and play that one game a week and it d be fine but with the amount of games and the speed of the game overall i don t think that mentality can last players will just break down is this just a higher caliber of athlete playing the sport or what do you think this is the result of it s that but it s other things too ten years ago we didn t have the same nutritional knowledge and we couldn t track training habits as well now you have everything at the touch of your fingertips teams are doing all the right things for recovery from ice baths to treatments to doctors and then we re also just developing better players all over the world what about in the states the game has really boomed here since you first joined the national team where do you think american soccer is now and what do you think it needs to keep improving laughs it sort of makes realize how long i ve been around i ve seen some pretty dark days in soccer in this country where you almost weren t sure if mls was going to stick around so to see where it is now is truly remarkable as far as the national team we keep getting better talent wise but we have to make sure we advance in other areas too having smart and clever players as well as physically talented ones so that we can really compete with the best teams one day as a fan of the sport what teams do you like watching the most i still follow everton closely because of the time i spent there and obviously it seems most people love watching fc barcelona play as a whole those would be my two answers for the most part favorite players or is that too hard to say given that they re also competition i like watching cristiano play gareth bale too yaya toure i think he s a great player i like watching sergio aguero that s a good start but there are so many more guys i like watching too samsung s galaxy premise is clever a dream team match for the future of earth you re on that team with cristiano messi it s stacked would you guys just cakewalk to the world cup title this summer if you competed there together laughs no matter who you have it d be hard for any squad to go out and win the world cup on just talent but when you look at that group there are some older veteran leaders too guys who would be really fun to play with so we d have a good shot actually maybe they should do that have it where players make their own teams from all over the world there could even be a draft how fun would that be dude i d pay anything to watch that,1

s news feed what changed and why,as winston churchill once said â œto improve is to change to be perfect is to change often it s a maxim facebook seems to have adopted wholeheartedly when it comes to the news feed posts appearing in your news feed today likely look different from the posts you saw six months ago both in appearance and content the simple reason for this is facebook is learning more about you and that means the company s news feed algorithm is better at determining what you like and what you dislike the average facebook user has roughly stories per day that could appear in their news feed facebook surfaces about of those stories that s where the algorithm comes in and that s why facebook is constantly tweaking it the social network has been particularly busy with the news feed the past six months releasing a number of algorithm updates and a significant redesign it s all part of ceo mark zuckerberg s ultimate goal for the product to provide every user with a perfectly personalized digital newspaper what exactly has changed in the news feed algorithm in recent months and why here s everything you need to know what you re seeing more of auto play videos including ads facebook first tested auto play videos in the mobile news feed in september facebook s web version got auto play videos in december the company began testing auto play video ads a week later but postponed full implementation in march facebook announced auto play video ads would begin to roll out to all users over the next few months that means some of you know the ads all too well but if you re thinking auto play ads never seen one then rest assured you will these videos play automatically as you scroll through your news feed they won t have any sound unless a user clicks on them this does not include shared videos from third party sites like youtube but only videos uploaded directly to facebook what do you think of auto play video ads in your facebook news feed opens in a new window larger photos facebook began to include larger images in the news feed as part of the platform s redesign announced in march photos now span the entire width of the news feed this larger photo feature was about the only one of a set of news feed changes promised back in march that actually arrived we were promised tabs and multiple feeds that users could subscribe to none have surfaced so far the only other change from this round worth noting the default font changed slightly facebook rolled out a news feed redesign last month that means pictures appear bigger in news feed the bottom image is from the old design credit facebook high quality news stories facebook altered its news feed algorithm in december in order to surface more high quality content on the platform that means more news and current events according to the company s blog this change affected the news feed in both its desktop and mobile versions although facebook says mobile users should notice the greater difference the company hopes to be a competitor to twitter when it comes to breaking news and the social conversations that result from it this is also the reason you may notice more resurfaced content as part of the algorithm change that surfaces more high quality content facebook really wants to make sure you saw those stories to the point where they will pop up even if you ve read them that may be annoying for some users but the social network really wants to make sure you re not missing a conversation your friends might be having around those hot button articles here s facebook s explanation for the change courtesy of the company blog opens in a new window after people read a story they are unlikely to go back and find that story again to see what their friends were saying about it and it wouldnâ t bump up in news feed with this update stories will occasionally resurface that have new comments from friends still users complain about seeing the same content over and over our recommendation like the stuff you want to see more of and either don t engage with or hide the posts you don t enjoy via a drop down menu next to the name of whomever posted it be aware that if you hide a post you re less likely to see any posts from that person more content from brands facebook made another small algorithm tweak in february to help brands expand their audience if a brand tags another brand in a post their content can now reach fans of both brand pages for example if mcdonald s mentions its partnership with nba star lebron james and tags him in the post as they did below that post may now appear in news feed for fans of either mcdonalds or lebron it s a simple way for brands to expand reach and may mean more brand content in your feed mcdonald s tagged lebron in this post meaning it could appear in the news feed of fans of either mcdonald s or lebron credit facebook what you re seeing less of meme photos when facebook decided to highlight more high quality content within news feed there was a necessary corollary less low quality stuff what counts as low quality facebook has been frustratingly imprecise in its definition except to say that it s not singling out any particular website for demotion one example of demoted content the social network gave in this allthingsd opens in a new window interview late last year meme photos itâ s not like youâ re never going to see a funny cat photo from imgur said news feed manager lars backstrom itâ s that maybe youâ ll see percent less of that and percent more articles spammy links have you ever clicked on a link that takes you to a page full of ads there are a lot of four letter words you may use to refer to these links especially if you get duped into clicking on one but facebook is choosing to call them spammy and wants to eliminate them from news feed the company announced an algorithm tweak last week that will identify posts with spammy links and keep them from surfacing to other users facebook says that when users visit a link and fail to like or share the original post it tends to be spammy its not a perfect system of course but we appreciate the attempt like baiting if a post asks you to like share or comment it s gaming the facebook system that type of engagement is what helps identify the good posts from the bad posts the company is trying to put a stop to the posts that actively asks users to like it an example of like baiting credit facebook this was part of the algorithm change announced last week so you may not notice much of a difference yet you can also do your part to keep like baiting stories away from your friends hide them ultimately you have more control over what you see in the news feed than you may think the best way to ensure you see what you care about is to engage with the posts you like best like comment or share them and hide the ones you don t,1

finds arsenic poisoning in chilean mummies,people of numerous pre columbian civilizations in northern chile including the incas and the chinchorro culture suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning due to their consumption of contaminated water new research suggests previous analyses showed high concentrations of arsenic opens in a new window in the hair samples of mummies from both highland and coastal cultures in the region however researchers weren t able to determine whether the people had ingested arsenic opens in a new window or if the toxic element in the soil had diffused into the mummies hair after they were buried in the new study scientists used a range of high tech methods to analyze hair samples from a to year old mummy from the tarapacã valley in chile s atacama desert they determined the high concentration of arsenic in the mummy s hair came from drinking arsenic laced water and possibly eating plants irrigated with the toxic water in chile you have these sediments that are rich in arsenic because of copper mining activities in the highlands which expose arsenic and other pollutants said lead study author ioanna kakoulli an archaeological scientist at the university of california los angeles when it rains the arsenic can leach out into the rivers analyzing hair in fields ranging from forensics to archaeology hair is widely used to gain insight into the lives of modern and past peoples unlike other biological samples such as bone and skin tissue that change over time hair remains stable after it forms keratinizes this feature along with hair s steady growth rate opens in a new window means that it can provide a chronological record of the substances that previously circulated in the blood in the past scientists have analyzed the hair samples of the mummies from the pre columbian populations that lived in chile s atacama desert between a d and the remains showed patterns of chronic poisoning which some researchers have suspected was due to these populations consumption of water contaminated with arsenic but the methods didn t allow them to determine how the arsenic got into the mummies hair they didn t map where the arsenic is precipitated on the hair â they just took it and dissolved it kakoulli told live science with this technique you cannot tell if the arsenic wound up in the hair externally or if it was ingested and traveled through the bloodstream first she said to learn more about the possible arsenic poisoning of the ancient people from northern chile kakoulli and her colleagues looked at a naturally preserved mummy opens in a new window that was buried in the a cemetery in the tarapacã valley of the atacama desert using portable techniques that were noninvasive and nondestructive they imaged and analyzed the mummy s skin clothes and hair as well as the soil encrusting the mummy as expected the team detected arsenic in the mummy s hair and in the soil they also discovered skin conditions indicative of arsenic poisoning opens in a new window though these findings were suggestive of arsenic ingestion they weren t definitive so the researchers collected hair samples to analyze further in the lab finding the source kakoulli and her colleagues imaged the hair samples with a very high resolution scanning electron microscope they also subjected the samples to various tests with the synchrotron light source â a large particle accelerator that analyzes materials with intense focused x ray beams â at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory in california allowing them to map the distribution of the elements and minerals in the hair their tests revealed a uniform radial distribution of arsenic in the hair if the hair had been contaminated from arsenic in the soil the toxic element would have only coated the surface kakoulli said comparisons of the arsenic in the soil and hair also showed the soil contained much lower concentrations of the element furthermore the dominant form of arsenic in the hair was a type called arsenic iii while the inorganic arsenic in surface water and groundwater opens in a new window is mostly arsenic v studies have suggested that the body biotransforms ingested arsenic into arsenic iii the results are consistent with modern epidemiological studies of arsenic poisoning by ingestion kakoulli said adding that the technological approach used in the study could prove useful to forensic investigations and toxicity assessments in archaeology the team is now using the same approach to see if the ancient people of the tarapacã valley used certain hallucinogens as some individuals were buried with exotic amazonian seeds and various hallucinogenic paraphernalia if the people buried with the items didn t use the hallucinogens it would suggest they were shaman or doctors who used the hallucinogenic plants to aid other people the researchers said it then becomes a question about the level of interaction they had with the people of the amazon because the seeds aren t from chile kakoulli said they would ve had to have known the properties of the seeds and where to get them,0

suffers astonishingly fast snowpack melt as drought intensifies,the severe drought that threatens water supplies and a potentially devastating wildfire season is deepening and locking into place across much of the far west southwest and southern plains according to new climate data released thursday in california s sierra nevada mountains where runoff from the spring snowpack provides much needed water supplies during the dry season half of the snowpack s liquid water equivalent opens in a new window melted in just the past week in some areas due to temperatures that soared as high as degrees fahrenheit above average of early april according to the u s drought monitor to make matters worse the sudden snow melt in california barely boosted reservoir supplies which remain well below average across the state officials already knew that the snowpack was unusually thin and would provide below average amounts of water when it melted considering that the state had its third driest winter on record following its driest calendar year in however they did not anticipate it would melt so quickly the california state snow survey on april found that the snowpack contained just of the average water content at that time of year when snowpack typically reaches its annual peak this placed as among the lowest water content years on record since such data began in the california drought is part of a broader regional drought that encompasses parts of oregon nevada colorado utah arizona new mexico texas and oklahoma among other areas in a conference call with reporters on thursday scientists from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa said the california drought is likely to persist opens in a new window throughout the summer after average precipitation fell during march this precipitation failed to make up for the deep precipitation deficits the state had been running southern plains drought according to noaa drought has expanded and intensified in the southern plains as well where parts of oklahoma and texas have been stuck in devastatingly arid conditions since the geographic extent of extreme and exceptional drought has increased nearly four fold in texas more than five fold in oklahoma and nearly six fold in new mexico since the beginning of winter according to david brown a noaa climate specialist new mexico has had its third driest start to the year and oklahoma and texas have each had their sixth driest starts to the year brown says nearly two million southern plains residents are currently living in areas with extreme or exceptional drought conditions which are the two worst categories on the drought monitor s scale the number of affected residents more than doubled since the start of winter according to brown most of these people are in west texas and the texas panhandle including the cities of lubbock amarillo and wichita falls drought monitor image showing the extent and severity of drought conditions across texas on april the dark red areas are where the drought is most intense credit u s drought monitor in wichita falls city officials are preparing to raise their water restrictions to an unprecedented stage emergency which would trigger dramatic restrictions on water use the city also plans to spend on cloud seeding this spring opens in a new window to try to increase rainfall production from thunderstorms cloud seeding which can increase rainfall slightly under specific circumstances has no chance of alleviating the drought itself but it could provide some short term benefits since the start of the drought in october wichita falls has had about inches of rain and melted snow and ice brown said the typical amount for that period of time is inches this means that the city needs to make up about a year and a half s worth of precipitation alleviating the drought this spring and summer brown says would really take an unprecedented amount of spring rainfall â victor murphy a noaa meteorologist gave mashable further details on wichita falls plight he said data shows that the past months have been the driest such consecutive period on record in that city eclipsing any of the drought years in the and the dust bowl era for water planning purposes the early drought is considered to be the drought of record meaning that the current drought is worse than what policymakers may have prepared for the drought is raising concerns about wildfires and massive dust storms this summer and has already caused an agricultural disaster in the southern plains texas cattle herds have thinned out as ranchers are forced to send them to meat plants earlier than planned or move them northward to states that have water in response to the drought conditions from oklahoma to california meat prices have spiked to their highest level since and egg prices have also risen by nearly compared to last year according to the march consumer price index report opens in a new window avocado prices opens in a new window are also going up in response to the california drought although may and june are texas and oklahoma s wettest months on average there is such a big rainfall deficit in parts of these states that the drought will almost certainly not be fully eliminated if an el niã o event develops as expected by the fall it could lead to unusually wet conditions from california to texas next winter but that is neither guaranteed to happen nor would it be of any help in the short term,0

launches nearby friends location feature for meet ups irl,facebook has always encouraged you to share with your friends your favorite movies pictures and life updates now facebook wants you sharing your location too the social network on thursday announced nearby friends a new feature built into facebook s mobile app that allows you to see which of your friends are close by and even share your exact location with others the new feature uses the geolocation technology in your smart phone to determine when you are close to one of your facebook friends when activated the feature will send periodic notifications alerting you to friends who are nearby users have been able to check in on facebook for some time meaning you can already share your location as part of a post but nearby friends allows you to broadcast your general location to facebook friends without posting at all the new feature is opt in meaning you ll need to activate it within the app should you choose to participate users who do not activate nearby friends won t be affected in any way and will not share with or receive any location information from others on the platform â œthe mission of facebook is to connect people to bring people together says andrea vaccari the product manager for the new feature nearby friends sort of pushes that forward by making it a little easier to find new opportunities to meet your friends while youâ re out and about â how to use nearby friends to see friends in your area turn on nearby friends in settings within the mobile app this feature is opt in meaning you must manually activate it if you want to be seen or see others once the feature is activated you ll go through a small tutorial that explains how to use the feature you can select the groups on facebook with which you want to share your location you can t share your location with the public or with friends of friends you can only share it with friends or other groups that you have created like close friends or family facebook will notify you when friends are nearby at which point you can message those friends if you want to connect you won t be able to see a friend s exact location however for example the app may say that a friend is within two miles but the exact coordinates will not be shared automatically the app won t specify a distance closer than miles but nearby friends can discover people that are much further away even on a separate coast one facebook employee used the feature to track another employee s travels through europe you can show your exact location to a friend if you so choose by sharing your location on a map for a set amount of time until p m for example or by sharing your location indefinitely when you choose this option the friend you share with will have access to your exact location in real time sharing your specific location may make sense if you are trying to help someone find you for lunch or drinks otherwise simply being alerted that a friend is in the area may be enough if you turn on nearby friends it will not turn off automatically you will continue to broadcast your approximate location until the feature is manually turned off users be reminded that they are sharing their location thanks to push notifications says vaccari nearby friends sends users notifications when their facebook friends are close by credit facebook the new feature is intended to help friends meet offline says vaccari whose startup glancee was acquired by facebook back in vaccari who grew up in italy was building similar technology at glancee in order to meet new people a challenge he faced when he came to the united states at facebook the technology only applies to a user s friends which vaccari believes will encourage more people to try it out facebook has been testing the feature with the vast majority of the company s plus employees for close to months according to vaccari during that time facebook used employee feedback to shape the feature and hone the notification algorithm at the beginning users received notifications that they had friends nearby all the time says vaccari those notifications were scaled back as the product evolved alerting you that a friend is nearby every time you walk into the office or get home to your roommate defeated the purpose the team decided like many of facebook s technologies the feature adapts as it learns more about you â œthe app learns where you spend most of your time and it avoids sending notifications when youâ re at those locations explains vaccari facebook collects this data and stores it on company servers but vaccari claims that it will never be used for purposes outside of nearby friends users can delete this data from the servers at any time by clearing their activity within settings he adds for many users the thought of facebook collecting data about the places they visit most often is frightening a fear vaccari is aware of it s one of the reasons the feature is opt in and a major reason you can only see and share with friends and not strangers â œwe are totally ok with people not wanting to opt in right away he says users can share their precise location with individual friends if they want to otherwise friends will just see a general location credit facebook facebook will begin posting in users news feeds to encourage users to try out the service those who don t have nearby friends activated will see upsell ads reminders that the feature is available those who do have the feature activated will be reminded it s turned on with similar stories that highlight who among their friends is also using the service ceo mark zuckerberg promised in january that facebook would be launching a number of standalone apps this year but nearby friends is obviously not one of them instead the feature has been built into the existing facebook flagship app in order to maximize facebook s user base offering the product as a standalone app would have given vaccari and his team more flexibility but in order to get users on board they wanted to go where the users already were nearby friends is only available in the united states and will be rolling out to users slowly a strategy facebook often implements with new products both ios and android users will be able to get the update after nearly two years of working on the product vaccari is ready to see it in the hands of everyday users not just facebook employees â œmy hope is that people will see from their friends that there is actually a lot of value in this experience he says i m curious to see how people are going to use it,1

s a ford mustang on the empire state building but good luck seeing it,if you put a car on the observatory of the empire state building people are going to come to see it so itâ s no surprise that when ford finally unveiled its mustang convertible stories up there were hundreds of people packed cheek by jowl around it it was to put it simply a mob scene iâ d already written about how ford did it for the second time in years but wednesday night was my first chance to see the proof to ride up floors through three elevators and stand beside the car that had been chopped up into six pieces carted up those same elevators and rebuilt on the empire state buildingâ s iconic observation deck the event wasn t just a simple photo op ford was in the mood to celebrate and the empire state buildingâ s floor offered food pounding music and incredible views of the city and that eveningâ s sunset ford executives mingled with journalists and guests but there was never a moment where anyone paused to say a few words about â years of mustang â however there were signs everywhere of the history witnessed by the mustang which was actually unveiled at the world s fair in flushing meadows queens each decade had its own pillar listing important milestones from the past there was even a pair of classic mustang pinball games they were set for free play so naturally i spent a few minutes trying to beat the high score the views from the floor of the empire state building on that clear cool night were magnificent credit mashable lance ulanoff eventually we all started to line up for access to the observation deck before entering the empire state building i had noticed that there was a substantial line of tourists snaking around the building none of them were up with us at the party but i would soon discover where they all went ford executives and guests celebrate years of mustang credit mashable lance ulanoff the elevator ride between the party floor and the floor is rather quick and we rode up at a time packed into the small space like the mustang parts before us after one more brief elevator trip up to the floor we arrived and i found the tourists as i turned the corner into the enclosed area that circles the building and sits just inside the exposed observation deck i walked into a wall of journalists and families all pushing their way toward the outside though i could see a set of very bright lights in one corner of the observation deck i couldn t find the mustang where is it i thought am i in the wrong corner all i could see were people then as i pushed my way through a sea of humanity i caught a flash of yellow and i saw it or at least part of it a gleaming yellow ford mustang it was positioned near one corner of the observation deck people were pressed up against the car and a hapless empire state building guard was begging them not to touch or lean on it the crowd around the ford mustang is tight credit mashable lance ulanoff i cursed under my breath as i realized getting a decent photo of the car on the deck would be impossible slowly and deliberately i moved closer to the car and got wedged near the right rear bumper on the other side of the car nearest the observation deck corner was some precious open space i made it my mission to squeeze in there and try to get a good picture of the car in this chaotic environment this ford mustang was cut into pieces and reassembled on the empire state building s observation deck look closely and you can see how some pieces don t quite fit together credit mashable lance ulanoff as i got closer i noticed that while the car looked amazing there were some subtle signs of its recent reconstruction the left door didnâ t sit flush against the frame and the left hood and bumper were also out of alignment beyond that youâ d never know it had ridden to the top in pieces once i finally made it to the tiny yet open space behind the mustang convertible i didnâ t want to leave one because i could finally see the car and two because i didnâ t want to be squashed by the dozens of people who had the same goal as me seeing the car on the roof of the empire state building and surviving a better look at the ford mustang interior as it sits atop the empire state building credit eventually i was told to leave that space because other people wanted to get in and take a selfie or two beside the car i wormed my way out and found the elevators i paused briefly on the floor where ford executives were eating drinking and dancing i was too tired to join in and headed to the last elevator within minutes i was back at street level just shared a photo throughglass opens in a new window pic twitter com opens in a new window â lance ulanoff lanceulanoff april opens in a new window i took one last look up at the empire state building as on the floor i could not see a ford mustang from where i stood but i did notice the top of the tower engulfed in a riot of lights it too was celebrating the birthday of ford s most iconic vehicle with about as much restraint as i had witnessed the rest of the night,1

aftershock the new certificate threat,ten days after the heartbleed bug was first revealed to the public companies are scrambling to patch servers and update software but the crisis isn t over it s not enough for companies to simply patch the copy of openssl the software at the root of the heartbleed bug companies must also revoke and reissue digital certificates for their heartbleed vulnerable sites and the clock is ticking the dl on digital certificates a digital certificate often called an ssl certificate is most commonly used by a web browser to validate that a web server is secure the website applies for a certificate with a certification authority ca as a way to prove the site is who it says it is this certificate shows that website x is connected with a specific name email and dns address which helps prove its identity the green lock icon you see on your web browser shows that a valid ssl certificate is present and indicates that a site is who it says it is and it s safe to use this green icon indicates that a website is protected by a digital certificate and is who it says it is credit google the certificate authority ca looks for the presence of private keys on a website server to verify its identity as a result the security of these private keys are extremely important the biggest potential threat from heartbleed aren t user names and passwords but access to those private keys if someone could grab those private keys they could use them to make changes to the certificate or masquerade one site as having the identity of another a potential gold mine for phishing scams last week the content delivery network cloudflare challenged users to steal its private key from an unpatched server on its network to figure out just how big a threat heartbleed really was the results were clear opens in a new window within hours multiple user were successfully able to extract private keys from a vulnerable server reissue and revoke according to security services firm netcraft more than opens in a new window certificates are vulnerable to heartbleed every single one of those certificates needs to be reissued and revoked that process has started but it might not be happening fast enough as of tuesday morning netcraft reported that certificates opens in a new window have been revoked certificate authorities ca such as symantec and comodo are rushing to reissue and revoke certificates for its clients comodo s cto robin alden told pc pro opens in a new window that its renewal rates have gone up by a factor of between and as of thursday more than certificates have been revoked according to isc s crl activity tracker opens in a new window the vast majority of those revocations were issued on april and april this chart from the isc shows the number of security certificates revoked since heartbleed was made public credit isc not only do companies need to reissue new certificates they need to revoke the old certificates so that they will no longer work as netcraft details the revocation process opens in a new window has its problems still the firm notes that it s critical cloudflare announced thursday that it had completed its process opens in a new window of reissuing and revoking ssl certificates that it manages for its customers the company also provided technical details on how private keys can leak using ca list prices netcraft estimates that the cost of replacing all the potentially compromised certificates with brand new certificates could cost million fortunately most cas including comodo are not charging customers to reissue and revoke their old certificates in the immediate wake of heartbleed some companies opted to simply buy new certificates rather than going through the reissue process regardless the old certificates still need to be revoked and unfortunately that isn t always happening netcraft sums up the current situation while some companies quickly recognised the need to issue new certificates opens in a new window in response to the heartbleed bug the number of revocations has not kept up this is a mistake as there is little point issuing a new certificate if an attacker is still able to impersonate a website with the old one yahoo was one of the first companies to deploy new ssl certificates after the heartbleed bug became public knowledge but the certificate that was previously used by mlogin yahoo com has not yet been revoked â it has not been placed on a crl and the certificate s ocsp responder says the certificate is good yahoo is not the only company to have issued a new certificate without ensuring that the previously vulnerable certificate has been revoked other sites which fall into this category include banking websites such as credit suisse ch the united states senate large file transfer system at lfts senate gov and geotrust s ssl toolbox at in a new window geotrust is a brand owned by symantec the largest certificate authority some might argue that the chances of a site s keys being stolen before a server was patched might be low enough to not require immediate action that might be true but that s not a risk any major business or institution should be willing to take broader internet impact one of the problems with reissuing and revoking so many digital certificates at once is the impact it has on the broader internet web browsers check a site s digital certificate against a list of invalidated certificates maintained by each publicly trusted ca these certificate revocation lists crls are usually downloaded by your web browser because websites rarely change their certificates the lists are often short and the downloads have little visible impact the problem that we re going to face now and it s a problem that s only going to increase as more companies revoke their certificates is that this means that those crl lists are about to get a bunch of new entries really really quickly the current size of all crls used by publicly trusted authorities is about in size netcraft says the crls will grow by if all certificates affected by heartbleed are revoked that s a lot of data for browsers to download particularly for mobile devices moreover policies and industry standards dictate that cas are supposed to provide a response that is yes this is safe or no this is revoked in less than seconds changes made to even one site can require browsers to download tons of new data this is especially true when it comes to government crls from netcraft opens in a new window the largest crl is operated by the us department of the treasury and despite containing more than revocation entries it is only used by one publicly accessible certificate nonetheless any browser wishing to perform a crl check for that one site will have to download the whole list governments also feature amongst the worst performing crls for example the taiwanese government offers a crl at in a new window which would not respond when tested earlier today and the brazilian government offers several crls from its site at repositorio icpbrasil gov br but each took minutes to download despite being of relatively modest sizes according to cloudflare opens in a new window the crl from its primary ca globalsign grew from on monday to as of thursday the bandwidth associated with every browser downloading that new crl so as more companies revoke certificates expect the crl load to balloon even more this will inevitably lead to a slowdown across the web but really what s the alternative companies could stagger the revocation process as a way to prevent traffic slowdowns but that still comes with a cost security and piece of mind speaking to the washington post opens in a new window cybersecurity scholar jason healey sums up the situation quite well what s the other solution ask people to be vulnerable for longer that doesn t strike me as particularly reasonable the certificate revocation process has had major issues for years perhaps heartbleed can lead to some real work on making the process more reliable and more secure so that in the future mass revocations won t be as difficult but that s a takeaway for a future crisis for now companies still need to focus on reissuing digital certificates and just as important revoking the old ones,1

that will transform india in the next years,mumbai india â following the united states and china india is the worldâ s third largest internet population the country is projected to be home to million internet users by june â but thatâ s still only a fraction of the countryâ s billion population as access to the internet penetrates deeper into the indian population it is changing the ways politicians campaign companies lead and people connect mashable was in mumbai last week to explore the influence connectivity is having on the country at the first ever india socialgood opens in a new window conference the event brought together more than members of indiaâ s technology social media and non profit communities for a day of exchanging ideas and networking more than one million people participated in the social discussions and joined the event via livestream here are five key takeaways from the event which dive into the countryâ s powerful online potential is changing the game can you imagine more than billion people with access to the fastest possible mobile internet that will be the reality in india in a matter of years india relies primarily on mobile devices for digital communications and thatâ s certainly not going to change anytime soon indiaâ s first network arrived in april in kolkata west bengal since then has slowly spread throughout the country this february apple made a joint announcement with bharti airtel that it would bring mobile service to users of appleâ s latest phones in bangalore to date access has been primarily data only as becomes more widespread and accessible for all types of devices the potential increases for digital communications online media both large and small businesses entrepreneurship and mobile commerce many socialgood community members expressed particular excitement about future opportunities for mobile commerce and peer to peer lending million people connected on facebook on april the same day as the event facebook reported it had crossed the million users mark in india making it the second largest country on the social network behind only the united states where the company started however million users is still just a small percentage of indiaâ s overall population and the market still has potential for significant growth what you hear and see in mumbai is that in many ways facebook is the gateway to the internet for instance many small businesses have forgone original websites and sites such as yelp instead focusing on building out their company facebook pages india may also be the biggest reason that facebook acquired the messaging service whatsapp for billion it is an extremely popular service as it works across all smartphones using low amounts of data unlike sms text messages and is nearly free it also offers several features such as group messaging and audio and video messaging using little data making it by far the easiest and cheapest way to stay in touch and share information with others both domestically and internationally social media as a political force a group of girls in india protest cellphone use while driving credit peter fristedt social media is playing a major role in the indian national elections for the first time the bharatiya janata party has largely adopted social media in this election cycle creating several campaign activations for its candidate for prime minister narendra modi the candidate has a strong presence across platforms such as youtube facebook twitter google and indiaâ s own social media platform vebbler holograms of modi were shown at rallies and google hangouts were used to interact with the movementâ s supporters modi currently has million twitter followers and over million â œlikesâ on his facebook page as weâ ve seen in other elections around the world social media has the potential to play a big role it is very unclear how this will shape the current election in india as rahul gandhi the incumbent national congress partyâ s candidate for prime minister doesnâ t yet have a verified twitter account many are comparing the contrast of social media strategies in this election to the u s presidential race between barack obama and john mccain but one thing is clear with the rise of social networks in the country more young people are getting involved in the election as we have seen in the united states this yearâ s race could be the tipping point that will never again allow an indian national election to go without social media campaigns the new giving mandate the companies act was enacted april the start of indiaâ s fiscal year the mandate requires that one third of a companyâ s board is comprised of independent directors this board committee must ensure the company spends â œat least of the average net profits of the company made during the three immediately preceding financial yearsâ on corporate social responsibility csr initiatives conservative estimates calculate this will net billion annually if the company fails to spend this amount on csr the board must disclose why in its annual report the act defines csr as activities that promote poverty reduction education health environmental sustainability gender equality and vocational skills development companies can choose which area to invest in or contribute the amount to central or state government funds earmarked for socioeconomic development the csr legislation was a big topic of conversation among the businesspeople and ngo workers at india socialgood how this new mandate will work and what the total result of the giving will be is uncertain but what is clear is that both sides are working to ensure accountability transparency and measurement and social media can help play a major role women sitting on corporate boards by law another part of â œthe companies actâ mandates that corporations boards of directors include at least one female member while u s media writes countless op eds and twitter buzzes about getting more women to the top india has taken a proactive legal step to make it a reality reports indicate fewer than of indiaâ s female population is active in the workforce but the new legislation is a significant first step in incentivizing and rewarding professional women across india while it canâ t be known what the long term effects of this mandate will be in theory the law will provide opportunities for millions of indian women to take on high level management and strategy positions across the nationâ s top industries last year of board seats in the united states were held by women a relatively low number compared to the of swedish board seats and of norwegian board seats held by women however in india women hold only of corporate board positions a statistic

into the emotional side of video games developing hope healing and love,video games have always been a part of my life said jenova chen i always played games with my friends but as i got older my friends stopped playing chen president and co founder of thatgamecompany opens in a new window wondered why that was while his friends said they were too busy it wasn t that they didn t have time for other forms of entertainment people still read novels watched movies listened to music he said the fact that most of my friends are abandoning games makes me feel sad how can i help video games not just be for kids and respected from people of all ages and genders my dream is to make everyone love video games chen s hypothesis on how to solve this problem came about when he began studying at the university of southern california s interactive media division he felt games which originally came from a software background divided their genres based on technology they were built around such as massively multiplayer online games or first person shooters entertainment genres however are divided based on emotions romantic comedies action horror drama chen noticed the range of emotions games catered to only fit certain genres those generally popular with a young and male audience look at the genres women like a romantic comedy game doesn t exist few examples of a documentary game exist what is the equivalent of a real drama game they don t exist chen said emotion with that complexity for a more mature older audience are necessary to make medium like video games healthy so it can be highly respected like the film industry but the goal is deeper than respect chen hopes that creating games with real emotional weight will improve people s lives he and thatgamecompany have already seen success with their titles like flow flower cloud and journey which offer non traditional gaming experiences that are highly interactive and emotionally engaging journey in particular has had strong emotional reactions from fans which chen plans to detail in his upcoming talk for the games for change festival opens in a new window running april in new york city the playstation game follows a mysterious hooded figure on its journey to reach the top of a mountain through a dessert a palace dark caves and treacherous snow while the experience itself is only two to three hours long very different from normal games it focuses more on the sense of wonder players experience during the trip after releasing journey chen said he was flooded with very emotional responses from players around the world he recounted one veteran disabled in combat saying the game gave him hope and a desire to go out and live again others used the game to deal with grieving and loss he said during journey players can be joined by another random online player dressed in the same robe and hood that player can help them along and communicate in limited ways but their identity is completely anonymous chen said he received several letters from players dealing with the loss of a loved one where they had imagined that person was playing journey with them that projection helped them cope i would never expected that and wouldn t have believed it would happen if we didn t receive six or seven unrelated letters from around the world with very similar stories chen said these games have more meaning than just pleasure or just a moment of escape there is more power in these games when you are doing it right i think certain types of feelings can heal and change people can make their lives better chen said now we have refined our mission statement we want to make positive change to the human psyche worldwide even if you just think it s just entertainment to make that experience perfect and to make sure players get the optimal emotional experience chen s team relies on feedback during playtesting journey s development took three years he said because the team had to change the design of the game to assure everyone got the same experience the online multiplayer element was the thing causing all the trouble since companionship is a big theme of the game chen needed to make sure players acted like the right type of companions online for quite a while we had players being very mean to each other people are really aggressive in many other games online when the same player playing call of duty came over to journey we were expecting to reveal a positive side of humanity rather than a nasty side but it didn t happen part of the limited character interactions originally let characters physically touch each other with pushes or bumps players could even jump on each other s heads to reach higher obstacles what happened was that playtesters would use that ability to shove other players even going so far as to push other players in a pit so they would die and the game turned into people killing each other on a cliff for a while we were disappointed in our playtesters but then i realized our developers like to do it too chen said the players aren t evil the system just rewards that evil behavior instead chen said players in a new game are basically babies they come with a fresh moral slate and are just seeking feedback similar to how an infant would he explained an analogy a child psychologist had taught him about a baby hitting the kitchen table with a spoon the baby doesn t understand what it s doing it wants feedback if the baby is making noise and its parents run in to the room it looks at that is positive feedback rather than negative they like it more so they will make it louder chen said pushing off the cliff is maximum feedback so we realized we had to redesign the system chen will deliver his talk titled blank canvas designing a new era of emotional storytelling through games opens in a new window on april at nyu s skirball center for performing arts as part of the games for change festival the talk is open to festival ticket holders opens in a

discover earth cousin planet that could support life,for the first time scientists have discovered an earth size alien planet in the habitable zone of its host star an earth cousin that just might have liquid water and the right conditions for life the newfound planet called kepler was first spotted by nasa s kepler space telescope and circles a dim red dwarf star about light years from earth while the host star is dimmer than earth s sun and the planet is slightly bigger than earth the positioning of the alien world coupled with its size suggests that kepler could have water on its surface scientists say you can learn more about the amazing alien planet find in a video opens in a new window produced by space com one of the things we ve been looking for is maybe an earth twin which is an earth size planet in the habitable zone of a sunlike star tom barclay kepler scientist and co author of the new exoplanet research told space com this is an earth size planet in the habitable zone of a cooler star so while it s not an earth twin it is perhaps an earth cousin it has similar characteristics but a different parent potentially habitable planet scientists think that kepler the outermost of five planets found to be orbiting the star kepler orbits at a distance of million miles theoretically within the habitable zone for a red dwarf earth orbits the sun from an average distance of about million miles but the sun is larger and brighter than the kepler star meaning that the sun s habitable zone begins farther out from the star by comparison to kepler this is the first definitive earth sized planet found in the habitable zone around another star elisa quintana of the seti institute and nasa s ames research center and the lead author of a new study detailing the findings said in a statement other planets of various sizes have been found in the habitable zones opens in a new window of their stars however kepler is the first alien planet this close to earth in size found orbiting in that potentially life supporting area of an extrasolar system according to exoplanet scientists an historic discovery this is an historic discovery of the first truly earth size planet found in the habitable zone around its star geoff marcy an astronomer at the university of california berkeley who is unaffiliated with the research told space com via email this is the best case for a habitable planet yet found the results are absolutely rock solid the planet itself may not be but i d bet my house on it in any case it s a gem the newly discovered planet measures about earth radii making it slightly larger than earth opens in a new window but researchers still think the alien world may be rocky like earth researchers still aren t sure what kepler s atmosphere is made of a key element that could help scientists understand if the planet is hospitable to life what we ve learned just over the past few years is that there is a definite transition which occurs around about earth radii quintana said in a statement what happens there is that for radii between and earth radii the planet becomes massive enough that it starts to accumulate a very thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere so it starts to resemble the gas giants of our solar system rather than anything else that we see as terrestrial the edge of habitability kepler actually lies at the edge of the kepler star s habitable zone meaning that liquid water on the planet s surface could freeze according to study co author stephen kane of san francisco state university because of its position in the outer part of the habitable zone the planet s larger size could actually help keep its water liquid kane said in a statement since it is slightly bigger than earth kepler could have a thicker atmosphere which would insulate the planet and potentially keep its water in liquid form kane added it goes around its star over days but because its star is a lower mass than our sun the planet orbits slightly inner of where mercury orbits in our own solar system barclay said it s on the cooler edge of the habitable zone it s still well within it but it receives less energy than earth receives so if you re on this planet the star would appear dimmer exoplanet hunting in the future kepler could be too dim for follow up studies that would probe the planet s atmosphere nasa s james webb space telescope opens in a new window hubble s successor expected to launch to space in is designed to image planets around relatively nearby stars however the kepler system might be too far off for the powerful telescope to investigate barclay said scientists using the kepler telescope opens in a new window discovered kepler using the transit method when the planet moved across the face of its star from the telescope s perspective kepler recorded a slight dip in the star s brightness allowing researchers to learn more about the planet itself kepler suffered a major malfunction last year and is no longer working in the same fashion but scientists are still going through the spacecraft s trove of data searching for new alien worlds i find it simply awesome that we live in a time when finding potentially habitable planets is common and the method to find them is standardized mit exoplanet hunter and astrophysicist sara seager who is

new app may have the answer for jet lag,jet lag is a discomfort many of us will have experienced in the days following a long haul flight across time zones mathematicians in the us may have a jet lag cure in the form a new app called entrain opens in a new window but does it work our circadian clock which drives daily hour rhythms in our physiology and behavior is to blame for jet lag it cannot instantly reset to the destination time zone and the adjusting process can take a number of days the rate at which our clocks reset depends upon a number of factors including the number of time zones crossed the direction of travel east or west and the light exposure experienced before and upon arrival the aspect of jet lag that affects us most is the disruption it causes to our sleep we can experience problems both falling and staying asleep as well as waking up when we need to such that our sleep tends to be short in duration and poor in quality this then negatively affects our daytime levels of alertness and ability to perform cognitive and physical tasks the power of light light is the most effective stimulus for altering the timing of our circadian clock and synchronizing it appropriately to the local light dark cycle and desired wake sleep schedule by exposing yourself to light at appropriate times of day it is possible to trick your body into adjusting to the right rhythm and minimize the occurrence duration and impact of jet lag the reference point for light exposure is the time that your body temperature is at its lowest â this normally occurs about two hours before you wake up exposure to light before this point will push your clock later in time required when flying westwards whereas light after your lowest temperature time will bring your clock earlier in time required for eastwards travel one method of adaptation to the new time zone is to gradually adjust your body clock to the destination time zone before you fly by progressively altering your sleeping patterns and using bright light in the days before your trip if pre adjustment is not possible or convenient then you can help your clock adapt upon arrival by scheduling your exposure to light and dark trying to calculate a light dark schedule and adjust this as your clock adapts around your work or holiday plans can be a bit of a headache this is where the app may be able to help training your body clock the entrain app developed at the university of michigan uses mathematical models to calculate the most effective way of adapting to a new time zone for you it generates a customized schedule of light and darkness to be followed upon arrival on the basis of information you provide about your light exposure history typical sleep schedule at home and your itinerary in terms of expected time indoors and outdoors while away if you deviate from the planned schedule then you can just tell the app and it will revise prescriptions accordingly the researchers state that instead of gradually shifting the clock to the required time zone their app will rapidly push our clocks to where it needs to be faster than the one hour per day that has been the general consensus in the field the authors state that continuous light has the most impact on the bodyâ s circadian system and that simply adjusting the time of dawn and dusk through exposing our bodies to light is both practical easy to follow and efficient this is very different to current advice which schedules bright light for short periods relative to your lowest body temperature point speeding up the rate of adaptation to a new time zone is clearly advantageous but although these schedules are mathematically proven opens in a new window they now need real human data to support them the models appear to be primarily based on data obtained in the highly controlled artificial environment of a laboratory and it will be interesting to see how these translate to the real world it is also unclear whether the app takes into account the fact that every cell of the body has its own circadian clock coordinated by the master circadian clock in our brains following travel across time zones many of the biological disturbances we experience from jet lag are due to the clocks in our various organs and tissues re synchronizing at different rates thus the app may rapidly synchronize your brain clock but your physiology may be lagging behind so you may still suffer certain symptoms of jet lag due to this internal dissociation as the public starts to use this app they will provide the necessary feedback that will be crucial for validating the mathematical models used users can submit their data to the appâ s creators at the university of michigan along with feedback about their jet lag symptoms in order to build better models that may accelerate the process of overcoming jet lag,1

carried by protesters in kiev in ukraine s capital protesters wielded everything from hammers to wooden clubs full of nails to baseball bats nothing they used was a match for the real bullets fired by the government then controlled by russian ally yanukovych but they gave rioters a means to fight back which may have cost the protesters some support from abroad i also think that there is a

studies at the university of denver told mashable via email interestingly though the evidence suggests the exact inverse in many places the use of armor or weapons may repel sympathizers who see participation as more risky when protests take on this character thereby undermining the power of the movement images pitting shield carrying protesters against shield wielding riot police flooded out

in turkey there are very high penalties for assaulting a police officer jeffrey said he says that s a serious deterrent to a lot of citizens and a big reason why riots there have never escalated to the level of violence seen in kiev not so long ago a protester tries to protect himself from water projected by a water canon from police during clashes in taksim square in istanbul on june credit emrah gurel chenoweth is not so sure i think that the laws of the country matter less in matters of civil disobedience than we think she said in many cases protesting is already illegal so these people are already engaged in high risk collective action jeffrey believes turkey s recent past weighs heavily on the current level of violence and the weapons turkish rioters are willing to use in the clashes between left and right wing groups left hundreds dead and he says there has since been a resulting aversion to that level of brutality i think there is a real reluctance to return to the era of street battles jeffrey said protesters in istanbul and ankara turkey s capital were met with tear gas and water cannons during the most recent bouts of unrest in march but rioters have not

soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas at them to try to disperse the crowd rioters responded with live ammunition petrol bombs and grenades at least people died and were injured including police and soldiers the scene on april was perhaps foreshadowed on feb when five people died opens in a new window including one police officer after both sides took to firing bullets at each other this skirmish was between anti government protesters and police the use of deadly weapons in recent months marks a distinct escalation from the slingshots and simple gas masks seen in the above photos though a definitive reason for the escalation remains unclear but something else lewis said is quite clear demonstrations in thailand years ago might have resulted in a few paragraphs in the new york times now protest videos on youtube spread across the web on a semi regular basis resulting in more media coverage a better understanding of how protesters in different nations respond to government forces and greater tendency for rioters across the globe to learn and evolve from each other,1
